<p>A new look at a web-based book.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>This book site is set up using the static site generator Eleventy. If you want to use the build process, run the command <code>npm install</code>, and that should install the bits that you need (presuming you have Node and NPM installed already)</p>
<p>To run the build process and serve the site locally, use this combination of commends to build the Sass files and build/serve the site: <code>gulp &amp; npx @11ty/eleventy --serve</code></p>
<h2>Just the site</h2>
<p>If you want to just look at or work with the pre-built site, take a peek in the <code>_site</code> directory.</p>
