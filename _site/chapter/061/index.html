<p>
  The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to
  engage them, the Pequod&rsquo;s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep
  induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through
  which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground;
  that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish,
  and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off the
  Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.
</p>
<p>
  It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
  leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in
  what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that
  dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body;
  though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the
  power which first moved it is withdrawn.
</p>
<p>
  Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen
  at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that at last all
  three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing that we
  made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman. The waves,
  too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the wide trance of the sea,
  east nodded to west, and the sun over all.
</p>
<p>
  Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my
  hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me;
  with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty
  fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the
  capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue,
  glistening in the sun&rsquo;s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in the
  trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet,
  the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm
  afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some
  enchanter&rsquo;s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once
  started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts
  of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted
  forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted
  the sparkling brine into the air.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Clear away the boats! Luff!&rdquo; cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he
  dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.
</p>
<p>
  The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere
  the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward,
  but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he swam,
  that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders
  that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in whispers. So
  seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but
  silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails
  being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the monster
  perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and then sank
  out of sight like a tower swallowed up.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;There go flukes!&rdquo; was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
  Stubb&rsquo;s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was
  granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale
  rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker&rsquo;s boat, and much nearer
  to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honor of the
  capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become aware of
  his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use.
  Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play. And still puffing at
  his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault.
</p>
<p>
  Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy, he
  was going &ldquo;head out&rdquo;; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast
  which he brewed.*
</p>
<p>
  *It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the
  entire interior of the sperm whale&rsquo;s enormous head consists. Though
  apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him.
  So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does so when
  going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part
  of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water formation of the
  lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he thereby may be said
  to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a
  sharppointed New York pilot-boat.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Start her, start her, my men! Don&rsquo;t hurry yourselves; take plenty of time&mdash;but
  start her; start her like thunder-claps, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; cried Stubb,
  spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. &ldquo;Start her, now; give &rsquo;em the long
  and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy&mdash;start her, all;
  but keep cool, keep cool&mdash;cucumbers is the word&mdash;easy, easy&mdash;only
  start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the buried dead
  perpendicular out of their graves, boys&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Start her!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!&rdquo; screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old
  war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
  involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which
  the eager Indian gave.
</p>
<p>
  But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. &ldquo;Kee-hee!
  Kee-hee!&rdquo; yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,
  like a pacing tiger in his cage.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Ka-la! Koo-loo!&rdquo; howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a mouthful
  of Grenadier&rsquo;s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea.
  Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his men
  to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like
  desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the welcome cry was heard&mdash;&ldquo;Stand
  up, Tashtego!&mdash;give it to him!&rdquo; The harpoon was hurled. &ldquo;Stern all!&rdquo;
   The oarsmen backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing
  along every one of their wrists. It was the magical line. An instant
  before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the
  loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a hempen
  blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe.
  As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so also, just before
  reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through and through both of
  Stubb&rsquo;s hands, from which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas
  sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like
  holding an enemy&rsquo;s sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all
  the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Wet the line! wet the line!&rdquo; cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated
  by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into it.* More
  turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now
  flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego
  here changed places&mdash;stem for stern&mdash;a staggering business truly
  in that rocking commotion.
</p>
<p>
  *Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated,
  that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running line
  with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart
  for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most convenient.
</p>
<p>
  From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of
  the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would
  have thought the craft had two keels&mdash;one cleaving the water, the
  other the air&mdash;as the boat churned on through both opposing elements
  at once. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy
  in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a
  little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic
  gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main
  clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall
  form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to
  bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed
  passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat
  slackened his flight.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Haul in&mdash;haul in!&rdquo; cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
  towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet
  the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly
  planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the
  flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning out of
  the way of the whale&rsquo;s horrible wallow, and then ranging up for another
  fling.
</p>
<p>
  The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a
  hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled
  and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing
  upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every
  face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men. And all the
  while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle
  of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited
  headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line
  attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and again, by a few rapid
  blows against the gunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Pull up&mdash;pull up!&rdquo; he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
  relaxed in his wrath. &ldquo;Pull up!&mdash;close to!&rdquo; and the boat ranged along
  the fish&rsquo;s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned his
  long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully churning and
  churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the
  whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking ere he
  could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of
  the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting from his trance into that
  unspeakable thing called his &ldquo;flurry,&rdquo; the monster horribly wallowed in
  his blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so
  that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly
  to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the
  day.
</p>
<p>
  And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view;
  surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his
  spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush
  after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red
  wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran dripping
  down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, Mr. Stubb,&rdquo; said Daggoo.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Yes; both pipes smoked out!&rdquo; and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
  Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood
  thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.
