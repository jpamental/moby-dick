  <h1>
  CHAPTER 6. The Street.
</h1>
<p>
  If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an
  individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized
  town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll
  through the streets of New Bedford.
</p>
<p>
  In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently
  offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even
  in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes
  jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and
  Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared
  the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping. In these
  last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual
  cannibals stand chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom
  yet carry on their bones unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare.
</p>
<p>
  But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,
  and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft
  which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still
  more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town
  scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and
  glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows
  who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the
  whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came. In
  some things you would think them but a few hours old. Look there! that
  chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed
  coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. Here comes another with
  a sou&rsquo;-wester and a bombazine cloak.
</p>
<p>
  No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one&mdash;I mean a
  downright bumpkin dandy&mdash;a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his
  two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a
  country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
  reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the comical
  things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he
  orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers. Ah,
  poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling
  gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of
  the tempest.
</p>
<p>
  But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and
  bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer
  place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day
  perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador. As it
  is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they look so
  bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New
  England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like Canaan; a land,
  also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with milk; nor in the
  spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this,
  nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and
  gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they? how planted
  upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?
</p>
<p>
  Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
  mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses
  and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.
  One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of
  the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?
</p>
<p>
  In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
  daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You
  must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they
  have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn
  their lengths in spermaceti candles.
</p>
<p>
  In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples&mdash;long
  avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and
  bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their
  tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art;
  which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces
  of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation&rsquo;s final
  day.
</p>
<p>
  And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But
  roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is
  perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom
  of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls
  breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as
  though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the
  Puritanic sands.
