  At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and
  Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals
  of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in
  the Pacific.
</p>
<p>
  For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
  While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a
  boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
  bows instead of the stern.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What has he in his hand there?&rdquo; cried Starbuck, pointing to something
  wavingly held by the German. &ldquo;Impossible!&mdash;a lamp-feeder!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; said Stubb, &ldquo;no, no, it&rsquo;s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he&rsquo;s
  coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don&rsquo;t you see that big
  tin can there alongside of him?&mdash;that&rsquo;s his boiling water. Oh! he&rsquo;s
  all right, is the Yarman.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Go along with you,&rdquo; cried Flask, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can. He&rsquo;s
  out of oil, and has come a-begging.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the
  whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
  proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing
  really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did
  indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.
</p>
<p>
  As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding
  what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced
  his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the
  conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching
  his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness&mdash;his
  last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet
  captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by hinting that his ship was
  indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a <em>clean</em> one (that is, an
  empty one), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.
</p>
<p>
  His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
  ship&rsquo;s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
  mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that
  without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round
  his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.
</p>
<p>
  Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats
  that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod&rsquo;s keels.
  There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they were
  going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their
  flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a
  great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment
  upon the sea.
</p>
<p>
  Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped
  old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the
  unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the
  jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod
  in advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for such
  venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their
  wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him, because the
  white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell
  formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and
  laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself
  in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which
  seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters
  behind him to upbubble.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got some paregoric?&rdquo; said Stubb, &ldquo;he has the stomach-ache, I&rsquo;m
  afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse winds
  are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It&rsquo;s the first foul wind I ever
  knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must
  be, he&rsquo;s lost his tiller.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load
  of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so
  did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning
  over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the
  unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in
  battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Only wait a bit, old chap, and I&rsquo;ll give ye a sling for that wounded
  arm,&rdquo; cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Mind he don&rsquo;t sling thee with it,&rdquo; cried Starbuck. &ldquo;Give way, or the
  German will have him.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one
  fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most valuable
  whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with
  such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At
  this juncture the Pequod&rsquo;s keels had shot by the three German boats last
  lowered; but from the great start he had had, Derick&rsquo;s boat still led the
  chase, though every moment neared by his foreign rivals. The only thing
  they feared, was, that from being already so nigh to his mark, he would be
  enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass
  him. As for Derick, he seemed quite confident that this would be the case,
  and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the
  other boats.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The ungracious and ungrateful dog!&rdquo; cried Starbuck; &ldquo;he mocks and dares
  me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!&rdquo;&mdash;then
  in his old intense whisper&mdash;&ldquo;Give way, greyhounds! Dog to it!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I tell ye what it is, men&rdquo;&mdash;cried Stubb to his crew&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s
  against my religion to get mad; but I&rsquo;d like to eat that villainous Yarman&mdash;Pull&mdash;won&rsquo;t
  ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye love brandy? A hogshead
  of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why don&rsquo;t some of ye burst a
  blood-vessel? Who&rsquo;s that been dropping an anchor overboard&mdash;we don&rsquo;t
  budge an inch&mdash;we&rsquo;re becalmed. Halloo, here&rsquo;s grass growing in the
  boat&rsquo;s bottom&mdash;and by the Lord, the mast there&rsquo;s budding. This won&rsquo;t
  do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long of it is, men, will ye
  spit fire or not?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Oh! see the suds he makes!&rdquo; cried Flask, dancing up and down&mdash;&ldquo;What
  a hump&mdash;Oh, <em>do</em> pile on the beef&mdash;lays like a log! Oh! my lads,
  <em>do</em> spring&mdash;slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads&mdash;baked
  clams and muffins&mdash;oh, <em>do</em>, <em>do</em>, spring,&mdash;he&rsquo;s a hundred barreller&mdash;don&rsquo;t
  lose him now&mdash;don&rsquo;t oh, <em>don&rsquo;t!</em>&mdash;see that Yarman&mdash;Oh, won&rsquo;t
  ye pull for your duff, my lads&mdash;such a sog! such a sogger! Don&rsquo;t ye
  love sperm? There goes three thousand dollars, men!&mdash;a bank!&mdash;a
  whole bank! The bank of England!&mdash;Oh, <em>do</em>, <em>do</em>, <em>do!</em>&mdash;What&rsquo;s that
  Yarman about now?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
  advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of
  retarding his rivals&rsquo; way, and at the same time economically accelerating
  his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The unmannerly Dutch dogger!&rdquo; cried Stubb. &ldquo;Pull now, men, like fifty
  thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d&rsquo;ye say,
  Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for
  the honor of old Gayhead? What d&rsquo;ye say?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I say, pull like god-dam,&rdquo;&mdash;cried the Indian.
</p>
<p>
  Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod&rsquo;s
  three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
  momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the
  headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up proudly,
  occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of, &ldquo;There
  she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman!
  Sail over him!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all their
  gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not a
  righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of
  his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his
  white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick&rsquo;s boat was nigh to capsizing,
  and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;&mdash;that was a good
  time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took a mortal
  start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German&rsquo;s quarter. An
  instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the whale&rsquo;s
  immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming
  swell that he made.
</p>
<p>
  It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was now
  going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented
  jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to
  this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at
  every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways
  rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I seen a bird with
  clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air, vainly striving
  to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a voice, and with
  plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb
  brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice,
  save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the
  sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk,
  portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the
  stoutest man who so pitied.
</p>
<p>
  Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod&rsquo;s boats
  the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick chose to
  hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the
  last chance would for ever escape.
</p>
<p>
  But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three
  tigers&mdash;Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo&mdash;instinctively sprang to
  their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their
  barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three
  Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and
  white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale&rsquo;s headlong
  rush, bumped the German&rsquo;s aside with such force, that both Derick and his
  baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying
  keels.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my butter-boxes,&rdquo; cried Stubb, casting a passing glance
  upon them as he shot by; &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll be picked up presently&mdash;all right&mdash;I
  saw some sharks astern&mdash;St. Bernard&rsquo;s dogs, you know&mdash;relieve
  distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel a
  sunbeam! Hurrah!&mdash;Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a
  mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury
  on a plain&mdash;makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him
  that way; and there&rsquo;s danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a
  hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he&rsquo;s going to Davy Jones&mdash;all
  a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale carries the
  everlasting mail!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  But the monster&rsquo;s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he
  tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round the
  loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so
  fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust
  the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they caught repeated
  smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at last&mdash;owing to the
  perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the boats, whence the
  three ropes went straight down into the blue&mdash;the gunwales of the
  bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns tilted high
  in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they
  remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the
  position was a little ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and
  lost in this way, yet it is this &ldquo;holding on,&rdquo; as it is called; this
  hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is
  that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp
  lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be
  doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but reasonable
  to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under water, the more
  he is exhausted. Because, owing to the enormous surface of him&mdash;in a
  full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet&mdash;the
  pressure of the water is immense. We all know what an astonishing
  atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground,
  in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a
  column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight
  of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of
  twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on
  board.
</p>
<p>
  As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into
  its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort, nay,
  not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths; what landsman
  would have thought, that beneath all that silence and placidity, the
  utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony! Not eight
  inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows. Seems it credible
  that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the
  big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and to what? To three bits of
  board. Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said&mdash;&ldquo;Canst
  thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears? The
  sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the
  habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee;
  darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!&rdquo; This
  the creature? this he? Oh! that unfulfilments should follow the prophets.
  For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run
  his head under the mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod&rsquo;s
  fish-spears!
</p>
<p>
  In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent
  down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad enough to
  shade half Xerxes&rsquo; army. Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale
  must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Stand by, men; he stirs,&rdquo; cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly
  vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by
  magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every
  oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part
  from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce
  upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
  scared from it into the sea.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Haul in! Haul in!&rdquo; cried Starbuck again; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s rising.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand&rsquo;s breadth
  could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
  dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two ship&rsquo;s
  lengths of the hunters.
</p>
<p>
  His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals
  there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby
  when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in
  certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it
  is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that
  when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at
  once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is heightened by
  the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface,
  his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is
  the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior
  fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable
  period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the
  well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats
  pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and
  the lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from
  the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural
  spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its
  affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came,
  because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they
  significantly call it, was untouched.
</p>
<p>
  As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his
  form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed.
  His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As
  strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when
  prostrate, so from the points which the whale&rsquo;s eyes had once occupied,
  now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was
  none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must
  die the death and be murdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other
  merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that
  preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his
  blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or
  protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;A nice spot,&rdquo; cried Flask; &ldquo;just let me prick him there once.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Avast!&rdquo; cried Starbuck, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no need of that!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous
  jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable
  anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly
  darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over
  with showers of gore, capsizing Flask&rsquo;s boat and marring the bows. It was
  his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by loss of blood,
  that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made; lay panting on
  his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin, then over and over
  slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the white secrets of his
  belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most piteous, that last expiring
  spout. As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some
  mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the
  spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground&mdash;so the last long dying
  spout of the whale.
</p>
<p>
  Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
  showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately,
  by Starbuck&rsquo;s orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so
  that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a
  few inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when the
  ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was strongly
  secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless
  artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.
</p>
<p>
  It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the
  entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on
  the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of
  harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with
  the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to
  denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been some other
  unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration
  alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone
  being found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm
  about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And when? It might have been
  darted by some Nor&rsquo; West Indian long before America was discovered.
</p>
<p>
  What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet
  there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries, by
  the ship&rsquo;s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing
  to the body&rsquo;s immensely increasing tendency to sink. However, Starbuck,
  who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it
  so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship would have been
  capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when
  the command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable
  strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were
  fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime everything in
  the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was like
  walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and gasped.
  Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from
  their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows
  were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift
  from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the
  submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment whole
  tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed
  on the point of going over.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Hold on, hold on, won&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo; cried Stubb to the body, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be in such a
  devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go for
  it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of
  ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Knife? Aye, aye,&rdquo; cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter&rsquo;s heavy
  hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing at
  the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were given,
  when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every
  fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.
</p>
<p>
  Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale
  is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted
  for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its
  side or belly considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales
  that thus sank were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads
  of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might
  with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon
  specific gravity in the fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of
  buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest
  health, and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the
  warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even
  these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.
</p>
<p>
  Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
  accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty
  Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in
  no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his
  Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this
  incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances where,
  after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale again
  rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is obvious. Gases
  are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort
  of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.
  In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a
  Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty
  of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look for
  it when it shall have ascended again.
</p>
<p>
  It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
  the Pequod&rsquo;s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering
  her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back,
  belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible
  power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back&rsquo;s spout is so similar to the
  Sperm Whale&rsquo;s, that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it.
  And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this
  unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail, made after her four young
  keels, and thus they all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold,
  hopeful chase.
</p>
<p>
  Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.
