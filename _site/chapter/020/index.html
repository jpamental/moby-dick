  CHAPTER 20. All Astir.
</h1>
<p>
  A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod. Not
  only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on board,
  and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened
  that the ship&rsquo;s preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg
  seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp
  look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at
  the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were
  working till long after night-fall.
</p>
<p>
  On the day following Queequeg&rsquo;s signing the articles, word was given at
  all the inns where the ship&rsquo;s company were stopping, that their chests
  must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the
  vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving,
  however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they always give very
  long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail for several days.
  But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and there is no telling
  how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod was fully equipped.
</p>
<p>
  Every one knows what a multitude of things&mdash;beds, sauce-pans, knives
  and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are
  indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which
  necessitates a three-years&rsquo; housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all
  grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also
  holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as
  with whalemen. For besides the great length of the whaling voyage, the
  numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the
  impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented,
  it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most
  exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and
  loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends.
  Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and
  spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate ship.
</p>
<p>
  At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the
  Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water, fuel,
  and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time there was
  a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of
  things, both large and small.
</p>
<p>
  Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad&rsquo;s
  sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but
  withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if <i>she</i> could help it,
  nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting
  to sea. At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the
  steward&rsquo;s pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate&rsquo;s
  desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the
  small of some one&rsquo;s rheumatic back. Never did any woman better deserve her
  name, which was Charity&mdash;Aunt Charity, as everybody called her. And
  like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about
  hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that
  promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship
  in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in which she
  herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars.
</p>
<p>
  But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on
  board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a
  still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor
  Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him a
  long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down went
  his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a while Peleg
  came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men down the
  hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then concluded
  by roaring back into his wigwam.
</p>
<p>
  During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft,
  and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was
  going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would answer,
  that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard every day;
  meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything
  necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest
  with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but
  half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage, without once
  laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it, so
  soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea. But when a man suspects any
  wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter,
  he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself. And
  much this way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.
</p>
<p>
  At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly
  sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.
