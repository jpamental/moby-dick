CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.
</h1>
<p>
  The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from
  the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia. In
  a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra,
  Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast mole, or
  rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and dividing the long
  unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes.
  This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports for the convenience of
  ships and whales; conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and
  Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the
  west, emerge into the China seas.

<p>
  Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
  midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
  promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond to
  the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and considering
  the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and
  ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched,
  it seems a significant provision of nature, that such treasures, by the
  very formation of the land, should at least bear the appearance, however
  ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping western world. The
  shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering
  fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and
  the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the
  obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of
  ships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by day, have
  passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with the
  costliest cargoes of the east. But while they freely waive a ceremonial
  like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute.
</p>
<p>
  Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the low
  shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the vessels
  sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the point of
  their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have
  received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these corsairs
  has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present day, we
  occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in those waters,
  have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.
</p>
<p>
  With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits;
  Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and thence,
  cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here and there by
  the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain the far
  coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season there. By these
  means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm
  Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending upon the Line
  in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit,
  firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most
  known to frequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be
  presumed to be haunting it.
</p>
<p>
  But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew
  drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now, the
  circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no
  sustenance but what&rsquo;s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler.
  While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to
  foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but
  herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a whole lake&rsquo;s
  contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with utilities; not
  altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She carries years&rsquo; water
  in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat,
  the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish
  fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian
  streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China from
  New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the whale-ship, in
  all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her crew having
  seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you carry
  them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer&mdash;&ldquo;Well,
  boys, here&rsquo;s the ark!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java,
  in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the
  ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
  excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more
  upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to
  keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed
  on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was
  snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was descried. Almost renouncing
  all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh
  entered the straits, when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft,
  and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.
</p>
<p>
  But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which
  of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales,
  instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in
  former times, are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes
  embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous
  nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance
  and protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense
  caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising
  grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without
  being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what
  sometimes seems thousands on thousands.
</p>
<p>
  Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
  forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a
  continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
  noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right
  Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the cleft
  drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of the
  Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually rising
  and falling away to leeward.
</p>
<p>
  Seen from the Pequod&rsquo;s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the
  sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the air,
  and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the
  thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy
  autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.
</p>
<p>
  As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
  accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
  their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain;
  even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through
  the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and
  swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.
</p>
<p>
  Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling
  their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended
  boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through
  these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental
  seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number. And who could
  tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not
  temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped white-elephant in the
  coronation procession of the Siamese! So with stun-sail piled on
  stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans before us; when, of a
  sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to
  something in our wake.
</p>
<p>
  Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear.
  It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something
  like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and
  go; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling
  his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying,
  &ldquo;Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails;&mdash;Malays,
  sir, and after us!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should fairly
  have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit,
  to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift Pequod, with
  a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these
  tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen
  pursuit,&mdash;mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they were. As
  with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his forward turn
  beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the bloodthirsty
  pirates chasing <em>him</em>; some such fancy as the above seemed his. And when he
  glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was
  then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to
  his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both
  chasing and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd
  of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally
  cheering him on with their curses;&mdash;when all these conceits had
  passed through his brain, Ahab&rsquo;s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the
  black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being
  able to drag the firm thing from its place.
</p>
<p>
  But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when,
  after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at
  last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging
  at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to
  grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship, than to
  rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays. But
  still driving on in the wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating
  their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away,
  word was passed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by
  some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of
  the three keels that were after them,&mdash;though as yet a mile in their
  rear,&mdash;than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and
  battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked
  bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.
</p>
<p>
  Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after
  several hours&rsquo; pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a
  general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they
  were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert
  irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say
  he is gallied. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto
  rapidly and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout;
  and like King Porus&rsquo; elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they
  seemed going mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast
  irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their
  short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic.
  This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who,
  completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged
  dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of
  simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could
  not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional
  timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though banding
  together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have
  fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when
  herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre&rsquo;s pit, they will, at the
  slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,
  trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,
  therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before
  us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not
  infinitely outdone by the madness of men.
</p>
<p>
  Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet
  it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
  retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in
  those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone
  whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes&rsquo; time,
  Queequeg&rsquo;s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in
  our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight for
  the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the whale
  struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed
  is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the
  more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags
  you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect
  life and only exist in a delirious throb.
</p>
<p>
  As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
  speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we
  thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the
  crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a
  ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer through their
  complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what moment it may be
  locked in and crushed.
</p>
<p>
  But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off from
  this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away from
  that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time,
  Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way
  whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time to
  make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty
  was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the shouting
  part of the business. &ldquo;Out of the way, Commodore!&rdquo; cried one, to a great
  dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant
  threatened to swamp us. &ldquo;Hard down with your tail, there!&rdquo; cried a second
  to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself
  with his own fan-like extremity.
</p>
<p>
  All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by
  the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal
  size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other&rsquo;s grain
  at right angles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the
  middle of this block, and the other end of the line being looped, it can
  in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales
  that this drugg is used. For then, more whales are close round you than
  you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales are not every day
  encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you
  cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be
  afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these
  the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of
  them. The first and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales
  staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of
  the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and
  ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the
  clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in
  an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the
  boat&rsquo;s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came
  in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts
  in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.
</p>
<p>
  It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not
  that as we advanced into the herd, our whale&rsquo;s way greatly diminished;
  moreover, that as we went still further and further from the circumference
  of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last
  the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished;
  then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we glided between
  two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain
  torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the
  roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In
  this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface,
  called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in
  his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they
  say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted
  distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw
  successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and
  round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder
  to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the
  middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the density
  of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed
  axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.
  We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall
  that had only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of
  the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the
  women and children of this routed host.
</p>
<p>
  Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
  outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any
  one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the
  whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square miles.
  At any rate&mdash;though indeed such a test at such a time might be
  deceptive&mdash;spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that
  seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this
  circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked
  up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had
  hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping;
  or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and
  inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales&mdash;now
  and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake&mdash;evinced
  a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic
  which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they came
  snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it
  almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg
  patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance; but
  fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained from darting it.
</p>
<p>
  But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still
  stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in
  those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
  whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become
  mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth
  exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly
  and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different lives
  at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still
  spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;&mdash;even so did
  the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if
  we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their
  sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little
  infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might
  have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He
  was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered
  from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal
  reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring, the
  unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar&rsquo;s bow. The delicate side-fins, and
  the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the plaited crumpled
  appearance of a baby&rsquo;s ears newly arrived from foreign parts.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Line! line!&rdquo; cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; &ldquo;him fast! him
  fast!&mdash;Who line him! Who struck?&mdash;Two whale; one big, one
  little!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What ails ye, man?&rdquo; cried Starbuck.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Look-e here,&rdquo; said Queequeg, pointing down.
</p>
<p>
  As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of
  fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows
  the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the
  air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame
  Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not
  seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the
  maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub
  is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed
  divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan amours in
  the deep.<a href="#ch087-fn1" id="ch087-fnref1" class="footnote--reference">1</a>
</p>
<p>
  And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and
  affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
  fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled in
  dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my
  being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and
  while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and
  deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
  spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats, still
  engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly
  carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of room and
  some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight of the enraged
  drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles,
  was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is sometimes the custom when
  fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek to
  hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic
  tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which
  is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we
  afterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had
  broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon
  line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing
  among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the
  battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.
</p>
<p>
  But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle
  enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire
  the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening
  distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the
  unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in
  the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run away with the
  cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope attached to that
  weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his
  tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that
  tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently
  flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,
  wounding and murdering his own comrades.
</p>
<p>
  This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary
  fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a
  little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows
  from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the
  submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished; in more and more
  contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in
  thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was departing. A low advancing hum
  was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when
  the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came
  tumbling upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one
  common mountain. Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck
  taking the stern.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Oars! Oars!&rdquo; he intensely whispered, seizing the helm&mdash;&ldquo;gripe your
  oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,
  you Queequeg&mdash;the whale there!&mdash;prick him!&mdash;hit him! Stand
  up&mdash;stand up, and stay so! Spring, men&mdash;pull, men; never mind
  their backs&mdash;scrape them!&mdash;scrape away!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a
  narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor
  we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly, and at
  the same time earnestly watching for another outlet. After many similar
  hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had just been
  one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales, all violently
  making for one centre. This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the
  loss of Queequeg&rsquo;s hat, who, while standing in the bows to prick the
  fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy
  made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.
</p>
<p>
  Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
  resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having clumped
  together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their onward flight
  with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but the boats still
  lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped
  astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waifed. The
  waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of which are carried by every boat;
  and which, when additional game is at hand, are inserted upright into the
  floating body of a dead whale, both to mark its place on the sea, and also
  as token of prior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw
  near.
</p>
<p>
  The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
  saying in the Fishery,&mdash;the more whales the less fish. Of all the
  drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for the
  time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other craft
  than the Pequod.
</p>



<ol class="footnotes">
  
  <li id="ch087-fn1"><p>
    The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob:&mdash;a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter&rsquo;s lance, the mother&rsquo;s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute <em>more hominum</em>.
