  <h1>
  CHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires.
</h1>
<p>
  Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
  according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;
  neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an indifferent
  air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling
  away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year.
  Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his whale-boat as if
  the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his crew all invited
  guests. He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part
  of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box. When
  close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his
  unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.
  He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the
  most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the
  jaws of death into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there
  is no telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;
  but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable
  dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of
  the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something
  which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.
</p>
<p>
  What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going, unfearing
  man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of
  grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to
  bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that thing must have
  been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of
  the regular features of his face. You would almost as soon have expected
  him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe. He kept
  a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy
  reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in
  succession, lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then
  loading them again to be in readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed,
  instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into
  his mouth.
</p>
<p>
  I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
  peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether
  ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the
  numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the
  cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their
  mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubb&rsquo;s tobacco
  smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.
</p>
<p>
  The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard. A
  short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who
  somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and
  hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor
  with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to
  all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and
  mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible
  danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous
  whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat,
  requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time
  and trouble in order to kill and boil. This ignorant, unconscious
  fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he
  followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years&rsquo; voyage round
  Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time. As a
  carpenter&rsquo;s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind
  may be similarly divided. Little Flask was one of the wrought ones; made
  to clinch tight and last long. They called him King-Post on board of the
  Pequod; because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square
  timber known by that name in Arctic whalers; and which by the means of
  many radiating side timbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship
  against the icy concussions of those battering seas.
</p>
<p>
  Now these three mates&mdash;Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous
  men. They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
  Pequod&rsquo;s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which Captain
  Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these
  three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with their
  long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers; even as
  the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.
</p>
<p>
  And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic
  Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,
  who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the
  former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
  moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
  and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set down
  who the Pequod&rsquo;s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of them
  belonged.
</p>
<p>
  First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for
  his squire. But Queequeg is already known.
</p>
<p>
  Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
  promontory of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant
  of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring island of
  Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the fishery, they
  usually go by the generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego&rsquo;s long, lean,
  sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes&mdash;for an
  Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering
  expression&mdash;all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the
  unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the
  great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests
  of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the
  woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea;
  the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of
  the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would
  almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans,
  and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers
  of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate&rsquo;s squire.
</p>
<p>
  Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
  negro-savage, with a lion-like tread&mdash;an Ahasuerus to behold.
  Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors
  called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards
  to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,
  lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been anywhere
  in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most
  frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold life of
  the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of
  men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a
  giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his
  socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white
  man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a
  fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the
  Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him. As for the
  residue of the Pequod&rsquo;s company, be it said, that at the present day not
  one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the
  American whale fishery, are Americans born, though pretty nearly all the
  officers are. Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as
  with the American army and military and merchant navies, and the
  engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and
  Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the native American
  liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously
  supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen belong to
  the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to
  augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like
  manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the
  Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the
  passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no
  telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly
  all Islanders in the Pequod, <i>Isolatoes</i> too, I call such, not acknowledging
  the common continent of men, but each <i>Isolato</i> living on a separate
  continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these
  Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the
  sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to
  lay the world&rsquo;s grievances before that bar from which not very many of
  them ever come back. Black Little Pip&mdash;he never did&mdash;oh, no! he
  went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod&rsquo;s forecastle, ye shall
  ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time,
  when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in
  with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here,
  hailed a hero there!
