CHAPTER 134. The Chase&mdash;Second Day.
</h1>
<p>
  At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye see him?&rdquo; cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to
  spread.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;See nothing, sir.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought for;&mdash;the
  top-gallant sails!&mdash;aye, they should have been kept on her all night.
  But no matter&mdash;&rsquo;tis but resting for the rush.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,
  continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing
  by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the
  wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence
  acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders;
  that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they will,
  under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the
  direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of
  sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.
  And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a
  coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly
  to return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands
  by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present
  visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen
  headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass,
  with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through
  several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the
  creature&rsquo;s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to
  the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot&rsquo;s coast is to him. So that
  to this hunter&rsquo;s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing
  writ in water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as
  the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway
  is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their
  hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby&rsquo;s pulse; and lightly
  say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot,
  at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these
  Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the
  observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence
  this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this
  or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at
  all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman&rsquo;s
  allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is
  the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a
  quarter from his port? Inferable from these statements, are many
  collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales.
</p>
<p>
  The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball,
  missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;By salt and hemp!&rdquo; cried Stubb, &ldquo;but this swift motion of the deck creeps
  up one&rsquo;s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two brave
  fellows!&mdash;Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise, on
  the sea,&mdash;for by live-oaks! my spine&rsquo;s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait
  that leaves no dust behind!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;There she blows&mdash;she blows!&mdash;she blows!&mdash;right ahead!&rdquo; was
  now the mast-head cry.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye, aye!&rdquo; cried Stubb, &ldquo;I knew it&mdash;ye can&rsquo;t escape&mdash;blow on
  and split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow
  your trump&mdash;blister your lungs!&mdash;Ahab will dam off your blood,
  as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies of
  the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine worked
  anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt
  before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe
  of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed, as timid
  prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand of Fate had
  snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the previous day;
  the rack of the past night&rsquo;s suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind,
  reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying
  mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled along. The wind that
  made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms
  invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency
  which so enslaved them to the race.
</p>
<p>
  They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;
  though it was put together of all contrasting things&mdash;oak, and maple,
  and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp&mdash;yet all these ran into each
  other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and
  directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of the
  crew, this man&rsquo;s valor, that man&rsquo;s fear; guilt and guiltiness, all
  varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal
  goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.
</p>
<p>
  The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
  outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one
  hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others, shading
  their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all
  the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate. Ah!
  how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing
  that might destroy them!
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?&rdquo; cried Ahab, when, after the
  lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard. &ldquo;Sway
  me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that
  way, and then disappears.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
  other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for
  hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin
  on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air
  vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant halloo
  of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as&mdash;much nearer to the ship than
  the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead&mdash;Moby Dick
  bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not by
  the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White
  Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of
  breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the
  Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and
  piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of
  seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes
  off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of defiance.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;There she breaches! there she breaches!&rdquo; was the cry, as in his
  immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to
  Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
  against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for
  the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and stood
  there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity,
  to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!&rdquo; cried Ahab, &ldquo;thy hour and
  thy harpoon are at hand!&mdash;Down! down all of ye, but one man at the
  fore. The boats!&mdash;stand by!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
  shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and halyards;
  while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from his perch.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Lower away,&rdquo; he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat&mdash;a spare
  one, rigged the afternoon previous. &ldquo;Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine&mdash;keep
  away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!&rdquo;

<p>
  As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first
  assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three
  crews. Ahab&rsquo;s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them he
  would take the whale head-and-head,&mdash;that is, pull straight up to his
  forehead,&mdash;a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,
  such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale&rsquo;s sidelong vision.
  But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were
  plain as the ship&rsquo;s three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning
  himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing among
  the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling battle on
  every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat,
  seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those
  boats were made. But skilfully manÅ“uvred, incessantly wheeling like
  trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though,
  at times, but by a plank&rsquo;s breadth; while all the time, Ahab&rsquo;s unearthly
  slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.
</p>
<p>
  But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and
  recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines
  now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the
  devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now for a moment
  the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous
  charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more line: and then
  was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again&mdash;hoping that way to
  disencumber it of some snarls&mdash;when lo!&mdash;a sight more savage
  than the embattled teeth of sharks!
</p>
<p>
  Caught and twisted&mdash;corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose
  harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came
  flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab&rsquo;s boat. Only
  one thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached
  within&mdash;through&mdash;and then, without&mdash;the rays of steel;
  dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then,
  twice sundering the rope near the chocks&mdash;dropped the intercepted
  fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the
  White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other
  lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb
  and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks
  on a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in
  a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the
  wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred
  bowl of punch.
</p>
<p>
  While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after
  the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while aslope
  little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his legs
  upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily
  singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old man&rsquo;s line&mdash;now
  parting&mdash;admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom
  he could;&mdash;in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted
  perils,&mdash;Ahab&rsquo;s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by
  invisible wires,&mdash;as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the
  sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom, and
  sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell again&mdash;gunwale
  downwards&mdash;and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like
  seals from a sea-side cave.
</p>
<p>
  The first uprising momentum of the whale&mdash;modifying its direction as
  he struck the surface&mdash;involuntarily launched him along it, to a
  little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with
  his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes
  from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip
  or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and
  came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work for
  that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean, and
  trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his leeward way at a
  traveller&rsquo;s methodic pace.
</p>
<p>
  As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came
  bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating
  mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and safely
  landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles;
  livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies
  of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or
  even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day
  before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat&rsquo;s broken half,
  which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as
  the previous day&rsquo;s mishap.
</p>
<p>
  But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
  instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of
  Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory leg
  had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye, aye, Starbuck, &rsquo;tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he
  will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The ferrule has not stood, sir,&rdquo; said the carpenter, now coming up; &ldquo;I
  put good work into that leg.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;But no bones broken, sir, I hope,&rdquo; said Stubb with true concern.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!&mdash;d&rsquo;ye see it.&mdash;But
  even with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living
  bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that&rsquo;s lost. Nor white
  whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper
  and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape
  yonder roof?&mdash;Aloft there! which way?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Dead to leeward, sir.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of the
  spare boats and rig them&mdash;Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat&rsquo;s
  crews.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the
  unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane&mdash;there, that
  shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet. By
  heaven it cannot be!&mdash;missing?&mdash;quick! call them all.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  The old man&rsquo;s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the
  Parsee was not there.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The Parsee!&rdquo; cried Stubb&mdash;&ldquo;he must have been caught in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The black vomit wrench thee!&mdash;run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
  forecastle&mdash;find him&mdash;not gone&mdash;not gone!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
  nowhere to be found.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye, sir,&rdquo; said Stubb&mdash;&ldquo;caught among the tangles of your line&mdash;I
  thought I saw him dragging under.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;<i>My</i> line! <i>my</i> line? Gone?&mdash;gone? What means that little word?&mdash;What
  death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.
  The harpoon, too!&mdash;toss over the litter there,&mdash;d&rsquo;ye see it?&mdash;the
  forged iron, men, the white whale&rsquo;s&mdash;no, no, no,&mdash;blistered
  fool! this hand did dart it!&mdash;&rsquo;tis in the fish!&mdash;Aloft there!
  Keep him nailed&mdash;Quick!&mdash;all hands to the rigging of the boats&mdash;collect
  the oars&mdash;harpooneers! the irons, the irons!&mdash;hoist the royals
  higher&mdash;a pull on all the sheets!&mdash;helm there! steady, steady
  for your life! I&rsquo;ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive
  straight through it, but I&rsquo;ll slay him yet!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,&rdquo; cried Starbuck;
  &ldquo;never, never wilt thou capture him, old man&mdash;In Jesus&rsquo; name no more
  of this, that&rsquo;s worse than devil&rsquo;s madness. Two days chased; twice stove
  to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil
  shadow gone&mdash;all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:&mdash;what more
  wouldst thou have?&mdash;Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps
  the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea? Shall we be
  towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,&mdash;Impiety and blasphemy to hunt
  him more!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Starbuck, of late I&rsquo;ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that hour
  we both saw&mdash;thou know&rsquo;st what, in one another&rsquo;s eyes. But in this
  matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
  hand&mdash;a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This
  whole act&rsquo;s immutably decreed. &rsquo;Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
  years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates&rsquo; lieutenant; I act
  under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.&mdash;Stand
  round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a
  shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. &rsquo;Tis Ahab&mdash;his body&rsquo;s
  part; but Ahab&rsquo;s soul&rsquo;s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I
  feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a
  gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye&rsquo;ll hear me crack; and till ye
  hear <i>that</i>, know that Ahab&rsquo;s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men,
  in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they
  drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to
  sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick&mdash;two days he&rsquo;s floated&mdash;tomorrow
  will be the third. Aye, men, he&rsquo;ll rise once more,&mdash;but only to spout
  his last! D&rsquo;ye feel brave men, brave?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;As fearless fire,&rdquo; cried Stubb.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;And as mechanical,&rdquo; muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he
  muttered on: &ldquo;The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same to
  Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek to
  drive out of others&rsquo; hearts what&rsquo;s clinched so fast in mine!&mdash;The
  Parsee&mdash;the Parsee!&mdash;gone, gone? and he was to go before:&mdash;but
  still was to be seen again ere I could perish&mdash;How&rsquo;s that?&mdash;There&rsquo;s
  a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the
  whole line of judges:&mdash;like a hawk&rsquo;s beak it pecks my brain. <i>I&rsquo;ll</i>,
  <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> solve it, though!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.
</p>
<p>
  So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on
  the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
  grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns
  in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening
  their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab&rsquo;s
  wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as on the
  night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle; his hid,
  heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat due
  eastward for the earliest sun.
