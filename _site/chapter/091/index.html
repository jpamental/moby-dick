CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.
</h1>
<p>
  &ldquo;In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan,
  insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.&rdquo; <em>Sir T. Browne, V.E.</em>
</p>
<p>
  It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we
  were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the many
  noses on the Pequod&rsquo;s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three
  pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in
  the sea.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I will bet something now,&rdquo; said Stubb, &ldquo;that somewhere hereabouts are
  some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they
  would keel up before long.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance
  lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be
  alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours from
  his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and
  hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside
  must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has
  died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse. It
  may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale;
  worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living are incompetent
  to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that
  no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it. Yet are there
  those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained
  from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no means of the
  nature of attar-of-rose.
</p>
<p>
  Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman
  had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a
  nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those
  problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious
  dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely
  bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall
  see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale
  as this, however much he may shun blasted whales in general.
</p>
<p>
  The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he
  recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted
  round the tail of one of these whales.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pretty fellow, now,&rdquo; he banteringly laughed, standing in the
  ship&rsquo;s bows, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes of
  Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering their
  boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and
  sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow
  candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will get
  won&rsquo;t be enough to dip the Captain&rsquo;s wick into; aye, we all know these
  things; but look ye, here&rsquo;s a Crappo that is content with our leavings,
  the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the
  dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. Poor devil! I say,
  pass round a hat, some one, and let&rsquo;s make him a present of a little oil
  for dear charity&rsquo;s sake. For what oil he&rsquo;ll get from that drugged whale
  there, wouldn&rsquo;t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned cell. And
  as for the other whale, why, I&rsquo;ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and
  trying out these three masts of ours, than he&rsquo;ll get from that bundle of
  bones; though, now that I think of it, it may contain something worth a
  good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has
  thought of that. It&rsquo;s worth trying. Yes, I&rsquo;m for it;&rdquo; and so saying he
  started for the quarter-deck.
</p>
<p>
  By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether or
  no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of
  escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb
  now called his boat&rsquo;s crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing
  across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French
  taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a
  huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper spikes
  projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a symmetrical
  folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon her head boards, in large gilt
  letters, he read &ldquo;Bouton de Rose,&rdquo;&mdash;Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and
  this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.
</p>
<p>
  Though Stubb did not understand the <em>Bouton</em> part of the inscription, yet
  the word <em>rose</em>, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently
  explained the whole to him.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;A wooden rose-bud, eh?&rdquo; he cried with his hand to his nose, &ldquo;that will do
  very well; but how like all creation it smells!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had
  to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the
  blasted whale; and so talk over it.
</p>
<p>
  Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he bawled&mdash;&ldquo;Bouton-de-Rose,
  ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak English?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be the
  chief-mate.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;<em>What</em> whale?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The <em>White</em> Whale&mdash;a Sperm Whale&mdash;Moby Dick, have ye seen him?
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale&mdash;no.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Very good, then; good bye now, and I&rsquo;ll call again in a minute.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over
  the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands into a
  trumpet and shouted&mdash;&ldquo;No, Sir! No!&rdquo; Upon which Ahab retired, and
  Stubb returned to the Frenchman.
</p>
<p>
  He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains,
  and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with your nose, there?&rdquo; said Stubb. &ldquo;Broke it?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I wish it was broken, or that I didn&rsquo;t have any nose at all!&rdquo; answered
  the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much.
  &ldquo;But what are you holding <em>yours</em> for?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Oh, nothing! It&rsquo;s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain&rsquo;t it?
  Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,
  Bouton-de-Rose?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What in the devil&rsquo;s name do you want here?&rdquo; roared the Guernseyman,
  flying into a sudden passion.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Oh! keep cool&mdash;cool? yes, that&rsquo;s the word! why don&rsquo;t you pack those
  whales in ice while you&rsquo;re working at &rsquo;em? But joking aside, though; do
  you know, Rose-bud, that it&rsquo;s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
  such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn&rsquo;t a gill in his
  whole carcase.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I know that well enough; but, d&rsquo;ye see, the Captain here won&rsquo;t believe
  it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But
  come aboard, and mayhap he&rsquo;ll believe you, if he won&rsquo;t me; and so I&rsquo;ll get
  out of this dirty scrape.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,&rdquo; rejoined Stubb, and
  with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented
  itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the
  heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and
  talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their noses
  upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms. Now and then
  pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get
  some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in
  coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their nostrils. Others having broken
  the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously
  puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their olfactories.
</p>
<p>
  Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the
  Captain&rsquo;s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a fiery
  face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within. This
  was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against the
  proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the Captain&rsquo;s round-house
  (<em>cabinet</em> he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could not help
  yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times.
</p>
<p>
  Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
  Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
  expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who had
  brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him
  carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the
  slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore held his peace
  on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so
  that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and
  satirizing the Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their
  sincerity. According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man,
  under cover of an interpreter&rsquo;s office, was to tell the Captain what he
  pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter any
  nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.
</p>
<p>
  By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a small
  and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with large
  whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with
  watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely
  introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the
  aspect of interpreting between them.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What shall I say to him first?&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, &ldquo;you
  may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,
  though I don&rsquo;t pretend to be a judge.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;He says, Monsieur,&rdquo; said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his
  captain, &ldquo;that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain and
  chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a
  blasted whale they had brought alongside.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him
  carefully, I&rsquo;m quite certain that he&rsquo;s no more fit to command a whale-ship
  than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he&rsquo;s a baboon.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is
  far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us,
  as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his crew
  to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose the
  cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to them.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that&mdash;that&mdash;in
  fact, tell him I&rsquo;ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody
  else.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;He says, Monsieur, that he&rsquo;s very happy to have been of any service to
  us.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
  (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his
  cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,&rdquo; said the interpreter.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Thank him heartily; but tell him it&rsquo;s against my principles to drink with
  the man I&rsquo;ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;He says, Monsieur, that his principles won&rsquo;t admit of his drinking; but
  that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had
  best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for
  it&rsquo;s so calm they won&rsquo;t drift.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed
  the Guernsey-man to this effect,&mdash;that having a long tow-line in his
  boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter
  whale of the two from the ship&rsquo;s side. While the Frenchman&rsquo;s boats, then,
  were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at
  his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long
  tow-line.
</p>
<p>
  Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;
  hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the
  Pequod slid in between him and Stubb&rsquo;s whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly
  pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his
  intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous
  cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the
  body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he was
  digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck
  against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery
  buried in fat English loam. His boat&rsquo;s crew were all in high excitement,
  eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.
</p>
<p>
  And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and screaming,
  and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning to look
  disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when suddenly
  from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint stream of
  perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being
  absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with another,
  without at all blending with it for a time.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I have it, I have it,&rdquo; cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in
  the subterranean regions, &ldquo;a purse! a purse!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
  something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese;
  very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with your thumb;
  it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good friends, is
  ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Some six handfuls
  were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more,
  perhaps, might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab&rsquo;s loud
  command to Stubb to desist, and come on board, else the ship would bid
  them good bye.
