  <h1>
  CHAPTER 59. Squid.
</h1>
<p>
  Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her
  way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling her
  keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts
  mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a plain. And
  still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely, alluring jet
  would be seen.
</p>
<p>
  But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural
  spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when the
  long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across
  them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered together
  as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a
  strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.
</p>
<p>
  In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and
  higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before
  our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening for a
  moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose, and
  silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?
  thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once
  more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod, the
  negro yelled out&mdash;&ldquo;There! there again! there she breaches! right
  ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the
  bees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the
  bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his
  orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction indicated
  aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.
</p>
<p>
  Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
  gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the
  ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale
  he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed him;
  whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the
  white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for
  lowering.
</p>
<p>
  The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab&rsquo;s in advance, and all swiftly
  pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with oars
  suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot where
  it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the moment all
  thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which
  the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass,
  furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing cream-colour, lay floating
  on the water, innumerable long arms radiating from its centre, and curling
  and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any
  hapless object within reach. No perceptible face or front did it have; no
  conceivable token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on
  the billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.
</p>
<p>
  As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still
  gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice
  exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than
  to have seen thee, thou white ghost!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What was it, Sir?&rdquo; said Flask.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and
  returned to their ports to tell of it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel; the
  rest as silently following.
</p>
<p>
  Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with
  the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being so
  very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
  portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them
  declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few of
  them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and
  form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his
  only food. For though other species of whales find their food above water,
  and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains
  his whole food in unknown zones below the surface; and only by inference
  is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. At
  times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the
  detached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty
  and thirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to which these arms
  belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the
  sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order to
  attack and tear it.
</p>
<p>
  There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop
  Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in which
  the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some
  other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But much
  abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it.
</p>
<p>
  By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
  creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttle-fish,
  to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong,
  but only as the Anak of the tribe.
