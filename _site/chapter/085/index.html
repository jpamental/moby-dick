CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.
</h1>
<p>
  That for six thousand years&mdash;and no one knows how many millions of
  ages before&mdash;the great whales should have been spouting all over the
  sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so
  many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,
  thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale,
  watching these sprinklings and spoutings&mdash;that all this should be,
  and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter minutes
  past one o&rsquo;clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D. 1851), it
  should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are, after all,
  really water, or nothing but vapor&mdash;this is surely a noteworthy
  thing.
</p>
<p>
  Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
  contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills,
  the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined
  with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live
  a century, and never once raise its head above the surface. But owing to
  his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human
  being&rsquo;s, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the
  open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the
  upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for,
  in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s mouth is buried at least eight
  feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no
  connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and
  this is on the top of his head.
</p>
<p>
  If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable
  to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element,
  which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to
  the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I
  may possibly use some superfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it
  follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath,
  he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a
  considerable time. That is to say, he would then live without breathing.
  Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who
  systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the
  bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling
  a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between
  his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable
  involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when
  he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So
  that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a
  surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless
  desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four
  supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is
  indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and
  true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise
  inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in <em>having his spoutings out</em>, as
  the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising
  to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time
  exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven
  minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then
  whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over
  again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,
  so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his
  regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told,
  will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however,
  that in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one
  they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his
  spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere
  descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the
  whale&rsquo;s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not
  by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a
  thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O
  hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!
</p>
<p>
  In man, breathing is incessantly going on&mdash;one breath only serving
  for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to
  attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the
  Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.
</p>
<p>
  It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if
  it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I
  opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems
  obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to
  his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two
  elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But
  owing to the mystery of the spout&mdash;whether it be water or whether it
  be vapor&mdash;no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this
  head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper
  olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no
  Cologne-water in the sea.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
  canal, and as that long canal&mdash;like the grand Erie Canal&mdash;is
  furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward
  retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has
  no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely
  rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to
  say? Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to
  this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
  living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!
</p>
<p>
  Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for
  the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just
  beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this
  curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side
  of a street. But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a
  water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the
  mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed
  with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It
  is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal;
  but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water
  through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would
  seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm
  Whale&rsquo;s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if
  he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your
  watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme
  between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.
</p>
<p>
  But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You
  have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell
  water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle
  these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of
  all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be
  undecided as to what it is precisely.
</p>
<p>
  The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
  it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when,
  always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his
  spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around
  him. And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops
  of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely
  condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are not those
  identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is
  countersunk into the summit of the whale&rsquo;s head? For even when tranquilly
  swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump
  sun-dried as a dromedary&rsquo;s in the desert; even then, the whale always
  carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you
  will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.
</p>
<p>
  Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
  precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering
  into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to
  this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into
  slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often
  happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing
  so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with
  the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or otherwise, I
  cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among
  whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another
  thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet
  is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the
  investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout
  alone.
</p>
<p>
  Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My
  hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other
  reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the
  great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no
  common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is
  never found on soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are.
  He is both ponderous and profound. And I am convinced that from the heads
  of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil,
  Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible
  steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While composing a
  little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before
  me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and
  undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my
  hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin
  shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for
  the above supposition.
</p>
<p>
  And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
  behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
  head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable
  contemplations, and that vapor&mdash;as you will sometimes see it&mdash;glorified
  by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For,
  d&rsquo;ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor.
  And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine
  intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And
  for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or
  denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things
  earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes
  neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with
  equal eye.
