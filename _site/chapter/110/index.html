CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.
</h1>
<p>
  Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were
  perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it being calm
  weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the
  huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight sending those
  gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they go; and so
  ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons,
  that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask containing
  coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted placards, vainly warning
  the infatuated old world from the flood. Tierce after tierce, too, of
  water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves, and iron bundles of
  hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks were hard to get
  about; and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if you were treading over
  empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted
  demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all
  Aristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them
  then.
</p>
<p>
  Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
  bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh to
  his endless end.
</p>
<p>
  Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
  dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the higher
  you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer,
  must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but&mdash;as we have
  elsewhere seen&mdash;mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and finally
  descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all day in that
  subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and
  see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen, the harpooneers are the
  holders, so called.
</p>
<p>
  Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should have
  stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where, stripped
  to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that
  dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well.
  And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where,
  strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible
  chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after some days&rsquo; suffering,
  laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death. How
  he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there
  seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing. But as all else
  in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless,
  seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a strange softness of
  lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a
  wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die, or
  be weakened. And like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter,
  expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of
  Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by
  the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as
  any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly
  wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And
  the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all
  with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could
  adequately tell. So that&mdash;let us say it again&mdash;no dying Chaldee
  or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious
  shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay
  in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to
  his final rest, and the ocean&rsquo;s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and
  higher towards his destined heaven.
</p>
<p>
  Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself, what
  he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked. He
  called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was just
  breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced
  to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his
  native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died
  in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes, and that the fancy of
  being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not unlike the custom of
  his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched him out in
  his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes;
  for not only do they believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond
  all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with
  the blue heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way. He
  added, that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,
  according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the
  death-devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket,
  all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat
  these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but
  uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.
</p>
<p>
  Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was
  at once commanded to do Queequeg&rsquo;s bidding, whatever it might include.
  There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard, which, upon
  a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the
  Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to
  be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking
  his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his
  character, proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg&rsquo;s measure with
  great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg&rsquo;s person as he shifted the
  rule.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Ah! poor fellow! he&rsquo;ll have to die now,&rdquo; ejaculated the Long Island
  sailor.
</p>
<p>
  Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general
  reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin
  was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at
  its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to
  work.
</p>
<p>
  When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he
  lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether
  they were ready for it yet in that direction.
</p>
<p>
  Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on
  deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one&rsquo;s
  consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
  him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some
  dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly
  trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.
</p>
<p>
  Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an
  attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn
  from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of
  the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then
  ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the
  head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot;
  and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now
  entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of its
  comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then told
  one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his
  arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch
  he called it) to be placed over him. The head part turned over with a
  leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his
  composed countenance in view. &ldquo;Rarmai&rdquo; (it will do; it is easy), he
  murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.
</p>
<p>
  But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this
  while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him by
  the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where go
  ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the
  beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for
  me? Seek out one Pip, who&rsquo;s now been missing long: I think he&rsquo;s in those
  far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he must be very sad;
  for look! he&rsquo;s left his tambourine behind;&mdash;I found it. Rig-a-dig,
  dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I&rsquo;ll beat ye your dying march.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, &ldquo;that in
  violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and
  that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their wholly
  forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their
  hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this
  strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all our
  heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?&mdash;Hark! he speaks
  again: but more wildly now.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Form two and two! Let&rsquo;s make a General of him! Ho, where&rsquo;s his harpoon?
  Lay it across here.&mdash;Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game cock
  now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!&mdash;mind ye that;
  Queequeg dies game!&mdash;take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I
  say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward; died all
  a&rsquo;shiver;&mdash;out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the
  Antilles he&rsquo;s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he jumped
  from a whale-boat! I&rsquo;d never beat my tambourine over base Pip, and hail
  him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all
  cowards&mdash;shame upon them! Let &rsquo;em go drown like Pip, that jumped from
  a whale-boat. Shame! shame!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was
  led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.
</p>
<p>
  But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that
  his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there
  seemed no need of the carpenter&rsquo;s box: and thereupon, when some expressed
  their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his
  sudden convalescence was this;&mdash;at a critical moment, he had just
  recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore
  had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They
  asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign
  will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg&rsquo;s
  conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not
  kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,
  unintelligent destroyer of that sort.
</p>
<p>
  Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;
  that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing, generally
  speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day. So, in good
  time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after sitting on the
  windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he
  suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a
  good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then springing into the head of
  his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a
  fight.
</p>
<p>
  With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
  emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there. Many
  spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque
  figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was striving, in his
  rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body. And this
  tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island,
  who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on his body a complete
  theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of
  attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to
  unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even
  himself could read, though his own live heart beat against them; and these
  mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the
  living parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the
  last. And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild
  exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor
  Queequeg&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!&rdquo;
