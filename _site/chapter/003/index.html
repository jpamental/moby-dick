<h1>
  CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.
</h1>
<p id="p1">
  Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low,
  straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the
  bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large
  oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the
  unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study
  and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the
  neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
  purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first
  you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New
  England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of
  much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and
  especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
  entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild,
  might not be altogether unwarranted.
</p>
<p id="p2">
  But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,
  black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three
  blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy,
  soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.
  Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity
  about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath
  with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant. Ever and
  anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s
  the Black Sea in a midnight gale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the
  four primal elements.—It’s a blasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean
  winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.
  But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in
  the picture’s midst. <em>That</em> once found out, and all the rest were plain. But
  stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the
  great leviathan himself?
</p>
<p id="p3">
  In fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly
  based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I
  conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a
  great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three
  dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to
  spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself
  upon the three mast-heads.
</p>
<p id="p4">
  The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array
  of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth
  resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and
  one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment
  made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you
  gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have
  gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed
  with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and
  deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long lance, now wildly
  elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a
  sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was
  flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain
  off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like
  a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty
  feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump.
</p>
<p id="p5">
  Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut
  through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
  fireplaces all round—you enter the public room. A still duskier
  place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled
  planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s
  cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored
  old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like
  table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities
  gathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting from the
  further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a
  rude attempt at a right whale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the
  vast arched bone of the whale’s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive
  beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,
  bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another
  cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little
  withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums
  and death.
</p>
<p id="p6">
  Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true
  cylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses
  deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians
  rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to
  <em>this</em> mark, and your charge is but a penny; to <em>this</em> a penny more; and so on
  to the full glass—the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for
  a shilling.
</p>
<p id="p7">
  Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a
  table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of <em>skrimshander</em>. I sought
  the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room,
  received for answer that his house was full—not a bed unoccupied.
  “But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haint no objections to
  sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are goin’ a-whalin’,
  so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.”
 </p>
<p id="p8">
  I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever
  do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he
  (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was
  not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander further about a
  strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any
  decent man’s blanket.
</p>
<p id="p9">
  “I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper?
  Supper’ll be ready directly.”
 </p>
<p id="p10">
  I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the
  Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
  his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space
  between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he
  didn’t make much headway, I thought.
</p>
<p id="p11">
  At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining
  room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said
  he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a
  winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to
  our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the fare
  was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but
  dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a green
  box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.
</p>
<p id="p12">
  “My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead
  sartainty.”
 </p>
<p id="p13">
  “Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”
 </p>
<p id="p14">
  “Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, “the harpooneer
  is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don’t—he
  eats nothing but steaks, and he likes ’em rare.”
 </p>
<p id="p15">
  “The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”
 </p>
<p id="p16">
  “He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.
</p>
<p id="p17">
  I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark
  complexioned” harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so
  turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into bed
  before I did.
</p>
<p id="p18">
  Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what
  else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a
  looker on.
</p>
<p id="p19">
  Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord
  cried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing this
  morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we’ll
  have the latest news from the Feegees.”
 </p>
<p id="p20">
  A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,
  and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy
  watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all
  bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an
  eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat, and
  this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they made a
  straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the wrinkled
  little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all
  round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed
  him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a
  sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how
  long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the
  weather side of an ice-island.
</p>
<p id="p21">
  The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with
  the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about
  most obstreperously.
</p>
<p id="p22">
  I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he
  seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own
  sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as
  the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had
  ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a
  sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here
  venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet in
  height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have seldom
  seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his
  white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his
  eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.
  His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine
  stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the
  Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had
  mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more
  of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he
  was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge
  favourite with them, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s
  Bulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.
</p>
<p id="p23">
  It was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally
  quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little
  plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.
</p>
<p id="p24">
  No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal
  rather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but people
  like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping
  with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that
  stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was
  there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more
  than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than
  bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one
  apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own
  blanket, and sleep in your own skin.
</p>
<p id="p25">
  The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the
  thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a
  harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of
  the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.
  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home
  and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight—how
  could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
</p>
<p id="p26">
  “Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t
  sleep with him. I’ll try the bench here.”
 </p>
<p id="p27">
  “Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a
  mattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots
  and notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane
  there in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So
  saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first
  dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while
  grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the
  plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near
  spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the
  bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in
  the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the
  shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the
  middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown
  study.
</p>
<p id="p28">
  I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
  short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too
  narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than
  the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the first
  bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a
  little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found
  that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of
  the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another
  current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both
  together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of
  the spot where I had thought to spend the night.
</p>
<p id="p29">
  The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal a
  march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be
  wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon
  second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next
  morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be
  standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
</p>
<p id="p30">
  Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a
  sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began to think that
  after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this
  unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in
  before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become
  jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.
</p>
<p id="p31">
  But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,
  and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
</p>
<p id="p32">
  “Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep
  such late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.
</p>
<p id="p33">
  The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be
  mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he answered,
  “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to rise—yes,
  he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out a peddling,
  you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be,
  he can’t sell his head.”
 </p>
<p id="p34">
  “Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you
  are telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,
  landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday
  night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?”
 </p>
<p id="p35">
  “That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t sell
  it here, the market’s overstocked.”
 </p>
<p id="p36">
  “With what?” shouted I.
</p>
<p id="p37">
  “With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”
 </p>
<p id="p38">
  “I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better stop
  spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”
 </p>
<p id="p39">
  “May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I rayther
  guess you’ll be done <em>brown</em> if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin’
  his head.”
 </p>
<p id="p40">
  “I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at this
  unaccountable farrago of the landlord’s.
</p>
<p id="p41">
  “It’s broke a’ready,” said he.
</p>
<p id="p42">
  “Broke,” said I—“<em>broke</em>, do you mean?”
 </p>
<p id="p43">
  “Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”
 </p>
<p id="p44">
  “Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-storm—“landlord,
  stop whittling. You and I must understand one another, and that too
  without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can
  only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain
  harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you
  persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending
  to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design
  for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate
  and confidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to speak
  out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in
  all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in the first place, you
  will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if
  true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and
  I’ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, <em>you</em> I mean,
  landlord, <em>you</em>, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would
  thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”
 </p>
<p id="p45">
  “Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long
  sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy,
  this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived from the
  south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand heads (great
  curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and that one he’s
  trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it would not do to
  be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is goin’ to churches.
  He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin’ out of
  the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a
  string of inions.”
 </p>
<p id="p46">
  This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed
  that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at
  the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
  Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
  business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
</p>
<p id="p47">
  “Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”
 </p>
<p id="p48">
  “He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful
  late, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me
  slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room
  for two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,
  afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot
  of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow,
  Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that,
  Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;”
   and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead
  the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he
  exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that harpooneer to-night;
  he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then; <em>do</em> come; <em>won’t</em> ye
  come?”
 </p>
<p id="p49">
  I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was
  ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,
  with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers
  to sleep abreast.
</p>
<p id="p50">
  “There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest
  that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make
  yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from
  eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
</p>
<p id="p51">
  Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the
  most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced
  round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no
  other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls,
  and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not
  properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown
  upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman’s bag, containing the
  harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there
  was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the
  fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
</p>
<p id="p52">
  But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the
  light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive
  at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing
  but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags
  something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin.
  There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in
  South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer
  would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in
  that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a
  hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as
  though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I
  went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw
  such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I
  gave myself a kink in the neck.
</p>
<p id="p53">
  I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
  head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on
  the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in
  the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a
  little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half
  undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the
  harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I
  made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then
  blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care
  of heaven.
</p>
<p id="p54">
  Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there
  is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a
  long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly
  made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall
  in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under
  the door.
</p>
<p id="p55">
  Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
  head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word
  till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New
  Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without
  looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the
  floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of
  the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness
  to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in
  unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round—when,
  good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish,
  yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking
  squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a terrible bedfellow; he’s been
  in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But
  at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I
  plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black
  squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I
  knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred
  to me. I remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who,
  falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that
  this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with
  a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his
  outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make
  of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about,
  and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it
  might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of
  a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had
  never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these
  extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were
  passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at
  all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced
  fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a
  seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the
  middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly
  thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his
  hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh
  surprise. There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing
  but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head
  now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger
  stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than
  ever I bolted a dinner.
</p>
<p id="p56">
  Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it
  was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this
  head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance
  is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded
  about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was
  the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night.
  In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to
  address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed
  inexplicable in him.
</p>
<p id="p57">
  Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his
  chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with
  the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark
  squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’ War, and just escaped
  from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were
  marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of
  young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage
  or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in
  this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps
  the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens!
  look at that tomahawk!
</p>
<p id="p58">
  But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
  something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that
  he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or
  dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the
  pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a
  hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old Congo baby.
  Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black
  manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that
  it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished
  ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed
  it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and
  removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image,
  like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks
  inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very
  appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.

<p id="p59">
  I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill
  at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes
  about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places
  them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top
  and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a
  sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and
  still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be
  scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;
  then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it
  to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry
  sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics
  were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who
  seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or
  other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.
  At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously,
  and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a
  sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
</p>
<p id="p60">
  All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him
  now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and
  jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before
  the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been
  bound.
</p>
<p id="p61">
  But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.
  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an
  instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,
  he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was
  extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang
  into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden
  grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.
</p>
<p id="p62">
  Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against
  the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep
  quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural
  responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.
</p>
<p id="p63">
  “Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I
  kill-e.” And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in
  the dark.
</p>
<p id="p64">
  “Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch!
  Coffin! Angels! save me!”
 </p>
<p id="p65">
  “Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the
  cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot
  tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But
  thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in
  hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
</p>
<p id="p66">
  “Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t
  harm a hair of your head.”
 </p>
<p id="p67">
  “Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that that
  infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”
 </p>
<p id="p68">
  “I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads
  around town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look
  here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you
  sabbee?”
 </p>
<p id="p69">
  “Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and
  sitting up in bed.
</p>
<p id="p70">
  “You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing
  the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a
  really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all
  his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal.
  What’s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself—the
  man’s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me,
  as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a
  drunken Christian.
</p>
<p id="p71">
  “Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or
  whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn
  in with him. But I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It’s
  dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”
 </p>
<p id="p72">
  This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
  motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to
  say—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”
 </p>
<p id="p73">
  “Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”
 </p>
<p id="p74">
  I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
