  CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.
</h1>
<p>
  I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest; my
  oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more did I
  hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A wild,
  mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab&rsquo;s quenchless feud seemed
  mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster
  against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and
  revenge.
</p>
<p>
  For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded
  White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the
  Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a
  few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who
  as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed.
  For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they
  were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference, many of them
  adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom
  or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a
  single news-telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each
  separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all
  these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the
  spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special
  individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted,
  that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time,
  or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and
  malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had
  completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I
  say, that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick.
  Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not
  unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster
  attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave
  battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were
  content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the
  perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause.
  In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale
  had hitherto been popularly regarded.
</p>
<p>
  And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance
  caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of
  them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other
  whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these
  assaults&mdash;not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs,
  or devouring amputations&mdash;but fatal to the last degree of fatality;
  those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their
  terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude
  of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually
  come.
</p>
<p>
  Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
  horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do
  fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
  terrible events,&mdash;as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but,
  in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors
  abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to. And
  as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery
  surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and
  fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only
  are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness
  hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the
  most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly
  astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest
  marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest
  waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand
  shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught
  hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes,
  pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by
  influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty
  birth.
</p>
<p>
  No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the
  widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the
  end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and
  half-formed fÅ“tal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually
  invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly
  appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that
  few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of
  those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.
</p>
<p>
  But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
  Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale,
  as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died
  out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those this day among
  them, who, though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to
  the Greenland or Right whale, would perhaps&mdash;either from professional
  inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the
  Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially among
  those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never
  hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the
  leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the
  North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
  fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling.
  Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere
  more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.
</p>
<p>
  And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
  times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists&mdash;Olassen
  and Povelson&mdash;declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a
  consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so
  incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood. Nor
  even down to so late a time as Cuvier&rsquo;s, were these or almost similar
  impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron himself affirms
  that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are &ldquo;struck
  with the most lively terrors,&rdquo; and &ldquo;often in the precipitancy of their
  flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause
  instantaneous death.&rdquo; And however the general experiences in the fishery
  may amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to
  the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in
  some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.
</p>
<p>
  So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of
  the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the
  Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised
  Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare;
  such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully
  pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm
  Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to
  be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are some remarkable
  documents that may be consulted.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were
  ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing
  only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of
  any certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were
  sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered.
</p>
<p>
  One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
  with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the
  unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been
  encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.
</p>
<p>
  Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether
  without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets
  of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most
  erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the
  surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from
  time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory
  speculations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic modes
  whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with such
  vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.
</p>
<p>
  It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as
  well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that
  some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies
  have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is
  it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has been declared
  that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded
  very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some
  whalemen, that the Nor&rsquo; West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never
  a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience of
  living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello
  mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which
  the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more
  wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were
  believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage); these
  fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the
  whalemen.
</p>
<p>
  Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing
  that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive;
  it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still
  further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous,
  but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves
  of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still swim away
  unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood, such a
  sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows
  hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.
</p>
<p>
  But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
  the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the
  imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk
  that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was
  elsewhere thrown out&mdash;a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a
  high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the
  tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his
  identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the
  same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
  appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his
  vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea,
  leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden
  gleamings.
</p>
<p>
  Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
  deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,
  as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific
  accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than
  all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught
  else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent
  symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn round suddenly,
  and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or
  drive them back in consternation to their ship.
</p>
<p>
  Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar
  disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in the
  fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale&rsquo;s infernal
  aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused,
  was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent
  agent.
</p>
<p>
  Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his
  more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats,
  and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds
  of the whale&rsquo;s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that
  smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.
</p>
<p>
  His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
  eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
  dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking
  with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That
  captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his
  sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab&rsquo;s leg,
  as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no hired
  Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice. Small
  reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal
  encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all
  the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to
  identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual
  and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the
  monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men
  feel eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and
  half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning;
  to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the
  worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue
  devil;&mdash;Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but
  deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted
  himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and torments;
  all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all
  that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of
  life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and
  made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale&rsquo;s white
  hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from
  Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot
  heart&rsquo;s shell upon it.
</p>
<p>
  It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the
  precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster,
  knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal
  animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but
  felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this
  collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and
  weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in
  mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his
  torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made
  him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the
  encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from
  the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;
  and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his
  Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his
  mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in
  his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the
  gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with
  mild stun&rsquo;sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all
  appearances, the old man&rsquo;s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape
  Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light
  and air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,
  and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the
  direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved
  on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you
  think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler
  form. Ahab&rsquo;s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like
  the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but
  unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing
  monomania, not one jot of Ahab&rsquo;s broad madness had been left behind; so in
  that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had
  perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If
  such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general
  sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own
  mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one
  end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely
  brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.
</p>
<p>
  This is much; yet Ahab&rsquo;s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But
  vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far
  down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we
  here stand&mdash;however grand and wonderful, now quit it;&mdash;and take
  your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;
  where far beneath the fantastic towers of man&rsquo;s upper earth, his root of
  grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried
  beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the
  great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits,
  upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down
  there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family
  likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your
  grim sire only will the old State-secret come.
</p>
<p>
  Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are
  sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change,
  or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble;
  in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling was only
  subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate. Nevertheless,
  so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he
  stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but
  naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which
  had overtaken him.
</p>
<p>
  The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
  ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which
  always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present
  voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far
  from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of
  such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were
  inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was all the
  better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage and
  wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched without,
  with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea; such an one,
  could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his
  lance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason
  thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would
  seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the
  attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret
  of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed
  upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of
  hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but
  half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast
  and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They
  were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars
  from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and
  supernatural revenge.
</p>
<p>
  Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a
  Job&rsquo;s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up
  of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals&mdash;morally enfeebled
  also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
  Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
  Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered,
  seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him
  to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded
  to the old man&rsquo;s ire&mdash;by what evil magic their souls were possessed,
  that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much their
  insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be&mdash;what the White
  Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in
  some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great demon of
  the seas of life,&mdash;all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than
  Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one
  tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his
  pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a
  seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment
  of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the
  whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.
