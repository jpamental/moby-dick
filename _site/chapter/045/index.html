  CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.
</h1>
<p>
  So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as
  indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in
  the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is
  as important a one as will be found in this volume; but the leading matter
  of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in
  order to be adequately understood, and moreover to take away any
  incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in
  some minds, as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair.
</p>
<p>
  I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
  content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items,
  practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these
  citations, I take it&mdash;the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow
  of itself.
</p>
<p>
  First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
  receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
  interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the
  same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same private
  cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where three years
  intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may
  have been something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in
  the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore
  there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior,
  where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by
  serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common
  perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile,
  the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it
  had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the
  coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came
  together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known
  three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales
  struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective
  marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year
  instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and
  last, and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole
  under the whale&rsquo;s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I
  say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are
  three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have
  heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter
  there is no good ground to impeach.
</p>
<p>
  Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
  the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
  historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
  distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became
  thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
  peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in
  that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
  peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
  valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of
  the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a
  whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen
  were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he
  would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to
  cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that
  happen to know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive
  salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance
  further, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.
</p>
<p>
  But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
  celebrity&mdash;Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
  famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but
  he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a
  name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or CÃ¦sar. Was it not so, O
  Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long
  did&rsquo;st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft seen
  from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand Jack! thou
  terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the
  Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty jet they
  say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?
  Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old
  tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain prose, here are
  four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or
  Sylla to the classic scholar.
</p>
<p>
  But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various
  times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were
  finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by
  valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that express
  object as much in view, as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods,
  Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious
  murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip.
</p>
<p>
  I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
  mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
  printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole
  story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For this is one
  of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much
  bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest
  and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some hints touching
  the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the fishery, they might
  scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse and more
  detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.
</p>
<p>
  First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
  perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid
  conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur. One
  reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and
  deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home,
  however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose
  that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the
  whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the
  bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan&mdash;do you suppose that that
  poor fellow&rsquo;s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read
  to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular
  between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be
  called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you
  that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many
  others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death
  by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a
  boat&rsquo;s crew. For God&rsquo;s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles!
  not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man&rsquo;s blood was spilled
  for it.
</p>
<p>
  Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is
  an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when
  narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness,
  they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I
  declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses,
  when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.
</p>
<p>
  But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
  testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm
  Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously
  malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and
  sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale <em>has</em> done it.
</p>
<p>
  First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was
  cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats,
  and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales
  were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats,
  issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his
  forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than &ldquo;ten
  minutes&rdquo; she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has
  been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the
  land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once
  more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods
  shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time
  his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never
  tempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket.
  I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the
  tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed
  with his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the
  catastrophe.<a href="#ch045-fn1" id="ch045-fnref1" class="footnote--reference">1</a>
</p>
<p>
  Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a black
  night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable
  shore. &ldquo;The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the fears of
  being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks,
  with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation, seemed
  scarcely entitled to a moment&rsquo;s thought; the dismal looking wreck, and <em>the
  horrid aspect and revenge of the whale</em>, wholly engrossed my reflections,
  until day again made its appearance.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  In another place&mdash;p. 45,&mdash;he speaks of &ldquo;<em>the mysterious and
  mortal attack of the animal</em>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807 totally
  lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic particulars of
  this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter, though from the whale
  hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it.
</p>
<p>
  Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J&mdash;&mdash;, then
  commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be
  dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the
  harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, the
  Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength
  ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily
  denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war
  as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is
  more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable
  craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm
  whale, that begged a few moments&rsquo; confidential business with him. That
  business consisted in fetching the Commodore&rsquo;s craft such a thwack, that
  with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave
  down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore&rsquo;s
  interview with that whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus
  converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale
  will stand no nonsense.
</p>
<p>
  I will now refer you to Langsdorff&rsquo;s Voyages for a little circumstance in
  point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you must
  know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern&rsquo;s famous
  Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century. Captain
  Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we
  were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very
  clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on
  our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not till
  the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An uncommon
  large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost
  at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any one on board
  till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon
  him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him. We
  were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature,
  setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.
  The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below
  all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon
  some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost
  gravity and solemnity. Captain D&rsquo;Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to
  examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock,
  but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Now, the Captain D&rsquo;Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
  question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures
  as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near
  Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I have particularly
  questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff. He substantiates
  every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large one: a Russian
  craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle after
  bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.
</p>
<p>
  In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too,
  of honest wonders&mdash;the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
  Dampier&rsquo;s old chums&mdash;I found a little matter set down so like that
  just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a
  corroborative example, if such be needed.
</p>
<p>
  Lionel, it seems, was on his way to &ldquo;John Ferdinando,&rdquo; as he calls the
  modern Juan Fernandes. &ldquo;In our way thither,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;about four o&rsquo;clock
  in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the
  Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such
  consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to
  think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed, the shock
  was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck
  against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over, we cast the
  lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * * * * * The suddenness of the shock
  made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken
  out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was
  thrown out of his cabin!&rdquo; Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an
  earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a
  great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great
  mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the
  darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused
  by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.
</p>
<p>
  I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to
  me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more
  than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing
  boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long
  withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship
  Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me
  say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running
  sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and secured
  there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks
  off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm
  whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often
  with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his
  pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his
  character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and
  retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I
  must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration; a
  remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see,
  that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by
  plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels)
  are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say
  amen with Solomon&mdash;Verily there is nothing new under the sun.
</p>
<p>
  In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of
  Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius
  general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every
  way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been
  considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some
  one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be
  mentioned.
</p>
<p>
  Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of
  his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the
  neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels
  at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact
  thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is
  there any reason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster
  was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other
  reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a
  sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the
  sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep
  waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not,
  and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place
  for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have
  recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated
  instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am
  told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of
  the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of
  war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by
  the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
</p>
<p>
  In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance
  called <em>brit</em> is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have
  every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale&mdash;squid or
  cuttle-fish&mdash;lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large
  creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at
  its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and
  reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all
  human reasoning, Procopius&rsquo;s sea-monster, that for half a century stove
  the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm
  whale.

    The following are extracts from Chace&rsquo;s narrative: &ldquo;Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the exact manÅ“uvres which he made were necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.&rdquo; Again: &ldquo;At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion.&rdquo;
