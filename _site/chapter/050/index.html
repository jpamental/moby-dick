  CHAPTER 50. Ahab&rsquo;s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.
</h1>
<p>
  &ldquo;Who would have thought it, Flask!&rdquo; cried Stubb; &ldquo;if I had but one leg you
  would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my
  timber toe. Oh! he&rsquo;s a wonderful old man!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it so strange, after all, on that account,&rdquo; said Flask. &ldquo;If
  his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing. That
  would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other left,
  you know.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the
  paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is right
  for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the
  chase. So Tamerlane&rsquo;s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes,
  whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest
  of the fight.
</p>
<p>
  But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that
  with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
  considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
  extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
  comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man
  to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the joint-owners of
  the Pequod must have plainly thought not.
</p>
<p>
  Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his
  entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the
  chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his
  orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned
  to him as a regular headsman in the hunt&mdash;above all for Captain Ahab
  to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat&rsquo;s crew, he well knew
  that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the
  Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat&rsquo;s crew from them, nor had he
  in any way hinted his desires on that head. Nevertheless he had taken
  private measures of his own touching all that matter. Until Cabaco&rsquo;s
  published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure
  when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the
  customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time
  after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of
  making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the
  spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which
  when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when
  all this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an
  extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
  withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he
  evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is
  sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat&rsquo;s bow for bracing the
  knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how
  often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
  semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter&rsquo;s chisel
  gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there; all these
  things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But
  almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in
  Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he
  had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.
  But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as
  to any boat&rsquo;s crew being assigned to that boat.
</p>
<p>
  Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away;
  for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such
  unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
  nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers;
  and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found
  tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats,
  canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that Beelzebub himself
  might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the
  captain, and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the
  forecastle.
</p>
<p>
  But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
  phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were
  somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a
  muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this,
  by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked
  with Ahab&rsquo;s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a
  half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even authority
  over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an indifferent air
  concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as civilized, domestic people
  in the temperate zone only see in their dreams, and that but dimly; but
  the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic
  communities, especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent&mdash;those
  insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern
  days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth&rsquo;s primal
  generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection,
  and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as
  real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and
  to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed
  consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the uncanonical
  Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.
