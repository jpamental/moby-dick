  CHAPTER 28. Ahab.
</h1>
<p>
  For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen
  of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches,
  and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the
  only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin
  with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they but
  commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was there,
  though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now
  sacred retreat of the cabin.
</p>
<p>
  Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed
  aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
  disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea,
  became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at times by
  the ragged Elijah&rsquo;s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me,
  with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of. But poorly
  could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile
  at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.
  But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness&mdash;to call it so&mdash;which
  I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed
  against all warrantry to cherish such emotions. For though the
  harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric,
  heathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies
  which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I
  ascribed this&mdash;and rightly ascribed it&mdash;to the fierce uniqueness
  of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so
  abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect of the three chief
  officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to
  allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness
  in every presentment of the voyage. Three better, more likely sea-officers
  and men, each in his own different way, could not readily be found, and
  they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape
  man. Now, it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a
  space we had biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from
  it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we
  sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable
  weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and
  gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship
  was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and
  melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the
  forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail,
  foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab
  stood upon his quarter-deck.
</p>
<p>
  There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
  recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the
  fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or
  taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole
  high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an
  unalterable mould, like Cellini&rsquo;s cast Perseus. Threading its way out from
  among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny
  scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a
  slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular
  seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the
  upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single
  twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off
  into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. Whether
  that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some
  desperate wound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit consent,
  throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially by
  the mates. But once Tashtego&rsquo;s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the
  crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old
  did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the
  fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild
  hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an
  old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had
  never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old
  sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old
  Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor
  seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should
  be tranquilly laid out&mdash;which might hardly come to pass, so he
  muttered&mdash;then, whoever should do that last office for the dead,
  would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.
</p>
<p>
  So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid
  brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted
  that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric
  white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that
  this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the
  sperm whale&rsquo;s jaw. &ldquo;Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,&rdquo; said the old
  Gay-Head Indian once; &ldquo;but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another
  mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of
  the Pequod&rsquo;s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there
  was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His
  bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud;
  Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the ship&rsquo;s
  ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a
  determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless,
  forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his
  officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and
  expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, consciousness
  of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that, but moody
  stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the
  nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.
</p>
<p>
  Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But
  after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing
  in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily
  walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a
  little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if, when the
  ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the
  sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it came to pass, that
  he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all that he said,
  or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary
  there as another mast. But the Pequod was only making a passage now; not
  regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision
  the mates were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing,
  out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for
  that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his
  brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves
  upon.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant,
  holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood.
  For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to
  the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most
  thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to
  welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little
  respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More than once did
  he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man, would
  have soon flowered out in a smile.
