  CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.
</h1>
<p>
  I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the
  grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,
  though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
  bedfellow.
</p>
<p>
  However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good
  thing; the more&rsquo;s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper person,
  afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let
  him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. And the
  man that has anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is
  more in that man than you perhaps think for.
</p>
<p>
  The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
  night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were
  nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and
  sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and
  ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn,
  shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.
</p>
<p>
  You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This
  young fellow&rsquo;s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would
  seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from
  his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might
  say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still
  lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal; <i>he</i> doubtless has
  tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show a cheek like Queequeg?
  which, barred with various tints, seemed like the Andes&rsquo; western slope, to
  show forth in one array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Grub, ho!&rdquo; now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went
  to breakfast.
</p>
<p>
  They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in
  manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard, the
  great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men,
  they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere
  crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the
  taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of
  Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo&rsquo;s performances&mdash;this kind of
  travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social
  polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had
  anywhere.
</p>
<p>
  These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after
  we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some good
  stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man
  maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked
  embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the
  slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas&mdash;entire
  strangers to them&mdash;and duelled them dead without winking; and yet,
  here they sat at a social breakfast table&mdash;all of the same calling,
  all of kindred tastes&mdash;looking round as sheepishly at each other as
  though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green
  Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior
  whalemen!
</p>
<p>
  But as for Queequeg&mdash;why, Queequeg sat there among them&mdash;at the
  head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I
  cannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have
  cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and
  using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the
  imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him.
  But <i>that</i> was certainly very coolly done by him, and every one knows that
  in most people&rsquo;s estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.
</p>
<p>
  We will not speak of all Queequeg&rsquo;s peculiarities here; how he eschewed
  coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks,
  done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest
  into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there
  quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied
  out for a stroll.
