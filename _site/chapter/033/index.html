  <h1>
  CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.
</h1>
<p>
  Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as
  any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from
  the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of
  course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.
</p>
<p>
  The large importance attached to the harpooneer&rsquo;s vocation is evinced by
  the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more
  ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now
  called the captain, but was divided between him and an officer called the
  Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time
  made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain&rsquo;s
  authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the
  vessel; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the
  Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland
  Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch
  official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At
  present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of
  the captain&rsquo;s more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good
  conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely
  depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important
  officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a
  whaling ground) the command of the ship&rsquo;s deck is also his; therefore the
  grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live
  apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as
  their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded
  as their social equal.
</p>
<p>
  Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this&mdash;the
  first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen
  alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in
  most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part
  of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the captain&rsquo;s cabin,
  and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.
</p>
<p>
  Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of
  all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the
  community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or
  low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common
  luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work;
  though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous
  discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an
  old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances,
  live together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the
  quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.
  Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper
  parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any
  military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore
  the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.
</p>
<p>
  And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given
  to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever
  exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man
  to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and
  though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected
  with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms,
  whether of condescension or <i>in terrorem</i>, or otherwise; yet even Captain
  Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the
  sea.
</p>
<p>
  Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those
  forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally
  making use of them for other and more private ends than they were
  legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain,
  which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through those
  forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible
  dictatorship. For be a man&rsquo;s intellectual superiority what it will, it can
  never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, without
  the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in
  themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever keeps
  God&rsquo;s true princes of the Empire from the world&rsquo;s hustings; and leaves the
  highest honors that this air can give, to those men who become famous
  more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of
  the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead
  level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these small things when
  extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances
  even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the
  case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire
  encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before
  the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would
  depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever
  forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now
  alluded to.
</p>
<p>
  But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness
  and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must
  not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him;
  and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied
  me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at
  from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied
  air!
