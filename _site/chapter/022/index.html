  <h1>
  CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.
</h1>
<p>
  At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship&rsquo;s riggers,
  and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the
  ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift&mdash;a
  night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare
  Bible for the steward&mdash;after all this, the two Captains, Peleg and
  Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is all
  ready&mdash;just spoke to him&mdash;nothing more to be got from shore, eh?
  Well, call all hands, then. Muster &rsquo;em aft here&mdash;blast &rsquo;em!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,&rdquo; said Bildad,
  &ldquo;but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain
  Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the
  quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as well
  as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him
  was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But then, the
  idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship
  under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was not at
  all his proper business, but the pilot&rsquo;s; and as he was not yet completely
  recovered&mdash;so they said&mdash;therefore, Captain Ahab stayed below.
  And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant service
  many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after
  heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell
  merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for good
  with the pilot.
</p>
<p>
  But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg
  was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and
  not Bildad.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,&rdquo; he cried, as the sailors lingered at the
  main-mast. &ldquo;Mr. Starbuck, drive &rsquo;em aft.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Strike the tent there!&rdquo;&mdash;was the next order. As I hinted before,
  this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the
  Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to
  be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!&mdash;jump!&rdquo;&mdash;was the next
  command, and the crew sprang for the handspikes.
</p>
<p>
  Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is
  the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it
  known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots
  of the port&mdash;he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in
  order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned
  in, for he never piloted any other craft&mdash;Bildad, I say, might now be
  seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor,
  and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer
  the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about
  the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will. Nevertheless, not three
  days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed
  on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his
  sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman&rsquo;s berth.
</p>
<p>
  Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and
  swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would sink
  the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused on my
  handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we
  both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was
  comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be
  found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay;
  when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round, was
  horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his
  leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first kick.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Spring,
  thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don&rsquo;t ye spring, I
  say, all of ye&mdash;spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red
  whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I
  say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!&rdquo; And so saying, he moved along
  the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while
  imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I, Captain
  Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.
</p>
<p>
  At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It was a
  short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into night, we
  found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray
  cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of teeth on the
  bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white ivory tusks of
  some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows.
</p>
<p>
  Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the
  old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all
  over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes
  were heard,&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  <i>&ldquo;Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,
     Stand dressed in living green.
  So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
     While Jordan rolled between.&rdquo;</i>
</pre>
<p>
  Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They were
  full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in the
  boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was
  yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads and
  glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the spring,
  untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.
</p>
<p>
  At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no
  longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
  alongside.
</p>
<p>
  It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at
  this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet; very
  loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage&mdash;beyond
  both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned
  dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain;
  a man almost as old as he, once more starting to encounter all the terrors
  of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful
  of every interest to him,&mdash;poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the
  deck with anxious strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another
  farewell word there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked
  towards the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen
  Eastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right
  and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling
  a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and
  holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as
  much as to say, &ldquo;Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all his
  philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern came
  too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck&mdash;now a
  word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.
</p>
<p>
  But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about
  him,&mdash;&ldquo;Captain Bildad&mdash;come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the
  main-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now!
  Careful, careful!&mdash;come, Bildad, boy&mdash;say your last. Luck to ye,
  Starbuck&mdash;luck to ye, Mr. Stubb&mdash;luck to ye, Mr. Flask&mdash;good-bye
  and good luck to ye all&mdash;and this day three years I&rsquo;ll have a hot
  supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,&rdquo; murmured old Bildad,
  almost incoherently. &ldquo;I hope ye&rsquo;ll have fine weather now, so that Captain
  Ahab may soon be moving among ye&mdash;a pleasant sun is all he needs, and
  ye&rsquo;ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be careful in the
  hunt, ye mates. Don&rsquo;t stave the boats needlessly, ye harpooneers; good
  white cedar plank is raised full three per cent. within the year. Don&rsquo;t
  forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind that cooper don&rsquo;t waste
  the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in the green locker! Don&rsquo;t
  whale it too much a&rsquo; Lord&rsquo;s days, men; but don&rsquo;t miss a fair chance
  either, that&rsquo;s rejecting Heaven&rsquo;s good gifts. Have an eye to the molasses
  tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I thought. If ye touch at the
  islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication. Good-bye, good-bye! Don&rsquo;t keep
  that cheese too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it&rsquo;ll spoil. Be
  careful with the butter&mdash;twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye,
  if&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,&mdash;away!&rdquo; and with that,
  Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.
</p>
<p>
  Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
  screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave three
  heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone
  Atlantic.
