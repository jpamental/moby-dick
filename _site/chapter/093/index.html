CHAPTER 93. The Castaway.
</h1>
<p>
  It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most
  significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod&rsquo;s crew; an
  event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly
  merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy
  of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.
</p>
<p>
  Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some
  few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is to work
  the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing,
  these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats&rsquo;
  crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous
  wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It was
  so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by
  abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember his
  tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly.
</p>
<p>
  In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a
  white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in
  one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and
  torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom
  very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his
  tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer,
  freer relish than any other race. For blacks, the year&rsquo;s calendar should
  show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New
  Year&rsquo;s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was
  brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous
  ebony, panelled in king&rsquo;s cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all life&rsquo;s
  peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he had
  somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his
  brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily
  subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange
  wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural
  lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut, he had once
  enlivened many a fiddler&rsquo;s frolic on the green; and at melodious
  even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the round horizon into one
  star-belled tambourine. So, though in the clear air of day, suspended
  against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful
  glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its
  most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy ground, and then
  lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural gases. Then come out
  those fiery effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond,
  once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel
  stolen from the King of Hell. But let us to the story.
</p>
<p>
  It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb&rsquo;s after-oarsman
  chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed; and,
  temporarily, Pip was put into his place.
</p>
<p>
  The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness; but
  happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
  therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing
  him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to
  the utmost, for he might often find it needful.
</p>
<p>
  Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the
  fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened,
  in this instance, to be right under poor Pip&rsquo;s seat. The involuntary
  consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the
  boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against
  his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in
  it, when at last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale
  started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor
  Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged
  there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and
  neck.
</p>
<p>
  Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He hated
  Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended
  its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed
  interrogatively, &ldquo;Cut?&rdquo; Meantime Pip&rsquo;s blue, choked face plainly looked,
  Do, for God&rsquo;s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than half a minute,
  this entire thing happened.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Damn him, cut!&rdquo; roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was
  saved.
</p>
<p>
  So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by
  yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these irregular
  cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like, but still
  half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done, unofficially
  gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat,
  Pip, except&mdash;but all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice
  ever is. Now, in general, <em>Stick to the boat</em>, is your true motto in
  whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when <em>Leap from the boat</em>, is still
  better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give
  undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a
  margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and
  concluded with a peremptory command, &ldquo;Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the
  Lord, I won&rsquo;t pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can&rsquo;t afford to lose
  whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you
  would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don&rsquo;t jump any more.&rdquo;
    Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loved his fellow,
  yet man is a money-making animal, which propensity too often interferes
  with his benevolence.
</p>
<p>
  But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was
  under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time
  he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run,
  Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller&rsquo;s trunk. Alas!
  Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue
  day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all
  round, to the horizon, like gold-beater&rsquo;s skin hammered out to the
  extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip&rsquo;s ebon head showed like a
  head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.
  Stubb&rsquo;s inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In
  three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb.
  Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black
  head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the
  brightest.
</p>
<p>
  Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
  practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful
  lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the
  middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how
  when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea&mdash;mark how closely
  they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.
</p>
<p>
  But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he
  did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake, and
  he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very
  quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards
  oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested
  by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not
  unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called,
  is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies
  and armies.
</p>
<p>
  But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly spying
  whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and Stubb&rsquo;s boat
  was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that
  Pip&rsquo;s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably. By the merest
  chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little
  negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The
  sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his
  soul. Not drowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous
  depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and
  fro before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his
  hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities,
  Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the
  firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God&rsquo;s foot upon the
  treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him
  mad. So man&rsquo;s insanity is heaven&rsquo;s sense; and wandering from all mortal
  reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is
  absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent
  as his God.
</p>
<p>
  For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that
  fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what
  like abandonment befell myself.
