  CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.
</h1>
<p>
  Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man&rsquo;s ivory
  leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back,
  upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto!
  Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But
  what was still more curious, Flask&mdash;you know how curious all dreams
  are&mdash;through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be
  thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that
  kick from Ahab. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; thinks I, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the row? It&rsquo;s not a real leg,
  only a false leg.&rsquo; And there&rsquo;s a mighty difference between a living thump
  and a dead thump. That&rsquo;s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty
  times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member&mdash;that
  makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the
  while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed
  pyramid&mdash;so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I
  say, I was thinking to myself, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s his leg now, but a cane&mdash;a
  whalebone cane. Yes,&rsquo; thinks I, &lsquo;it was only a playful cudgelling&mdash;in
  fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me&mdash;not a base kick. Besides,&rsquo;
  thinks I, &lsquo;look at it once; why, the end of it&mdash;the foot part&mdash;what
  a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,
  <i>there&rsquo;s</i> a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a
  point only.&rsquo; But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I
  was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman,
  with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round.
  &lsquo;What are you &rsquo;bout?&rsquo; says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a
  phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. &lsquo;What am I about?&rsquo;
  says I at last. &lsquo;And what business is that of yours, I should like to
  know, Mr. Humpback? Do <i>you</i> want a kick?&rsquo; By the lord, Flask, I had no
  sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and
  dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout&mdash;what do you think, I
  saw?&mdash;why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of
  marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, &lsquo;I guess I
  won&rsquo;t kick you, old fellow.&rsquo; &lsquo;Wise Stubb,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;wise Stubb;&rsquo; and kept
  muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney
  hag. Seeing he wasn&rsquo;t going to stop saying over his &lsquo;wise Stubb, wise
  Stubb,&rsquo; I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I
  had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, &lsquo;Stop that
  kicking!&rsquo; &lsquo;Halloa,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the matter now, old fellow?&rsquo; &lsquo;Look ye
  here,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;let&rsquo;s argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn&rsquo;t
  he?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, he did,&rsquo; says I&mdash;&lsquo;right <i>here</i> it was.&rsquo; &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; says he&mdash;&lsquo;he
  used his ivory leg, didn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, he did,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Well then,&rsquo; says
  he, &lsquo;wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn&rsquo;t he kick with right
  good will? it wasn&rsquo;t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No,
  you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.
  It&rsquo;s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old
  England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen,
  and made garter-knights of; but, be <i>your</i> boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked
  by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; <i>be</i> kicked by
  him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can&rsquo;t
  help yourself, wise Stubb. Don&rsquo;t you see that pyramid?&rsquo; With that, he all
  of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the
  air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do
  you think of that dream, Flask?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;May be; may be. But it&rsquo;s made a wise man of me, Flask. D&rsquo;ye see Ahab
  standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing you
  can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever
  he says. Halloa! What&rsquo;s that he shouts? Hark!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What do you think of that now, Flask? ain&rsquo;t there a small drop of
  something queer about that, eh? A white whale&mdash;did ye mark that, man?
  Look ye&mdash;there&rsquo;s something special in the wind. Stand by for it,
  Flask. Ahab has that that&rsquo;s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this
  way.&rdquo;
