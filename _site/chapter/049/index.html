  <h1>
  CHAPTER 49. The Hyena.
</h1>
<p>
  There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair
  we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical
  joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects
  that the joke is at nobody&rsquo;s expense but his own. However, nothing
  dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He bolts down all
  events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible
  and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion
  gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for small difficulties and
  worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of life and limb; all
  these, and death itself, seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and
  jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old
  joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man
  only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of
  his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing
  most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke. There is nothing
  like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial,
  desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the
  Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Queequeg,&rdquo; said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck,
  and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water;
  &ldquo;Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?&rdquo; Without
  much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me to understand
  that such things did often happen.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Mr. Stubb,&rdquo; said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
  oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; &ldquo;Mr. Stubb, I
  think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
  mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose
  then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
  squall is the height of a whaleman&rsquo;s discretion?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Certain. I&rsquo;ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape
  Horn.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Mr. Flask,&rdquo; said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing close
  by; &ldquo;you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you tell me
  whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an
  oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death&rsquo;s
  jaws?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you twist that smaller?&rdquo; said Flask. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the law. I should
  like to see a boat&rsquo;s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost. Ha,
  ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind that!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of
  the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings in
  the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of common
  occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the superlatively
  critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into the
  hands of him who steered the boat&mdash;oftentimes a fellow who at that
  very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft
  with his own frantic stampings; considering that the particular disaster
  to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck&rsquo;s driving
  on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that
  Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in the
  fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck&rsquo;s
  boat; and finally considering in what a devil&rsquo;s chase I was implicated,
  touching the White Whale: taking all things together, I say, I thought I
  might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will. &ldquo;Queequeg,&rdquo; said
  I, &ldquo;come along, you shall be my lawyer, executor, and legatee.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their
  last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more fond
  of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had
  done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon the present
  occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart.
  Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that
  Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so
  many months or weeks as the case might be. I survived myself; my death and
  burial were locked up in my chest. I looked round me tranquilly and
  contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the
  bars of a snug family vault.
</p>
<p>
  Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,
  here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the
  devil fetch the hindmost.
