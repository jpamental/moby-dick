  CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.
</h1>
<p id="p1">
  As Queequeg’s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all
  day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I
  cherish the greatest respect towards everybody’s religious obligations,
  never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
  even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other
  creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism
  quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of a
  deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions
  yet owned and rented in his name.
</p>
<p id="p2">
  I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
  things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
  pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
  subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most absurd
  notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;—but what of that? Queequeg
  thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content; and
  there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let him be,
  I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—Presbyterians and Pagans
  alike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and
  sadly need mending.
</p>
<p id="p3">
  Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals
  must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no
  answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside. “Queequeg,” said I
  softly through the key-hole:—all silent. “I say, Queequeg! why don’t
  you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” But all remained still as before. I
  began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought he
  might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but the
  door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but
  a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the
  bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold
  resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg’s harpoon, which the
  landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to
  the chamber. That’s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon
  stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he
  must be inside here, and no possible mistake.
</p>
<p id="p4">
  “Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all still. Something must have happened.
  Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.
  Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I
  met—the chamber-maid. “La! la!” she cried, “I thought something must
  be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was
  locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it’s been just so silent ever
  since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your
  baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma’am!—Mistress! murder! Mrs.
  Hussey! apoplexy!”—and with these cries, she ran towards the
  kitchen, I following.
</p>
<p id="p5">
  Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
  vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation of
  attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy meantime.
</p>
<p id="p6">
  “Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and fetch
  something to pry open the door—the axe!—the axe! he’s had a
  stroke; depend upon it!”—and so saying I was unmethodically rushing
  up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot
  and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.
</p>
<p id="p7">
  “What’s the matter with you, young man?”
 </p>
<p id="p8">
  “Get the axe! For God’s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry it
  open!”
 </p>
<p id="p9">
  “Look here,” said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet, so
  as to have one hand free; “look here; are you talking about prying open
  any of my doors?”—and with that she seized my arm. “What’s the
  matter with you? What’s the matter with you, shipmate?”
 </p>
<p id="p10">
  In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the
  whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her
  nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’t
  seen it since I put it there.” Running to a little closet under the
  landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that
  Queequeg’s harpoon was missing. “He’s killed himself,” she cried. “It’s
  unfort’nate Stiggs done over again—there goes another counterpane—God
  pity his poor mother!—it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor
  lad a sister? Where’s that girl?—there, Betty, go to Snarles the
  Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with—“no suicides
  permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;”—might as well kill
  both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be merciful to his ghost! What’s that
  noise there? You, young man, avast there!”
 </p>
<p id="p11">
  And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open
  the door.
</p>
<p id="p12">
  “I don’t allow it; I won’t have my premises spoiled. Go for the locksmith,
  there’s one about a mile from here. But avast!” putting her hand in her
  side-pocket, “here’s a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s see.” And with
  that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg’s supplemental bolt
  remained unwithdrawn within.
</p>
<p id="p13">
  “Have to burst it open,” said I, and was running down the entry a little,
  for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should
  not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily
  rush dashed myself full against the mark.
</p>
<p id="p14">
  With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming against
  the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good heavens! there
  sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle of
  the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head. He
  looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat like a carved image with
  scarce a sign of active life.
</p>
<p id="p15">
  “Queequeg,” said I, going up to him, “Queequeg, what’s the matter with
  you?”
 </p>
<p id="p16">
  “He hain’t been a sittin’ so all day, has he?” said the landlady.
</p>
<p id="p17">
  But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like
  pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost
  intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;
  especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
  eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.
</p>
<p id="p18">
  “Mrs. Hussey,” said I, “he’s <em>alive</em> at all events; so leave us, if you
  please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.”
 </p>
<p id="p19">
  Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg
  to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could do—for
  all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a peg, nor
  say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in the
  slightest way.
</p>
<p id="p20">
  I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do
  they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so; yes,
  it’s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll get up
  sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God, and his
  Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don’t believe it’s very punctual
  then.
</p>
<p id="p21">
  I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long
  stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as
  they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig,
  confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after
  listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o’clock, I went up
  stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must
  certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he was
  just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to grow
  vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting
  there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a
  piece of wood on his head.
</p>
<p id="p22">
  “For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have
  some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But not a
  word did he reply.
</p>
<p id="p23">
  Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and
  no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to
  turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it
  promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary
  round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the
  faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of
  Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy
  position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched.
  Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan
  on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!
</p>
<p id="p24">
  But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of
  day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had
  been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun
  entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a
  cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again
  against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.
</p>
<p id="p25">
  Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion, be
  it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other
  person, because that other person don’t believe it also. But when a man’s
  religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him;
  and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in;
  then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the
  point with him.
</p>
<p id="p26">
  And just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed
  now, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise
  and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various
  religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show
  Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in
  cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless for
  the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common
  sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an extremely
  sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see
  him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.
  Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves
  in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved. This
  is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy
  notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather
  digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling;
  and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by
  Ramadans.
</p>
<p id="p27">
  I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia;
  expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in. He said no;
  only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great feast given by his
  father the king, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the
  enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the afternoon, and all
  cooked and eaten that very evening.
</p>
<p id="p28">
  “No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the
  inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had
  visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a
  great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard
  or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great
  wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and
  cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the
  victor’s compliments to all his friends, just as though these presents
  were so many Christmas turkeys.
</p>
<p id="p29">
  After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much
  impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed
  dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his own
  point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one third
  understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt
  thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did. He
  looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion, as
  though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be
  so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.
</p>
<p id="p30">
  At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty
  breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make
  much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod,
  sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.
