  <h1>
  CHAPTER 46. Surmises.
</h1>
<p>
  Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
  thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick;
  though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one
  passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long
  habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman&rsquo;s ways, altogether to
  abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if this were
  otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more influential with
  him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even considering his
  monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might
  have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that
  the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances
  that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one
  he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were
  still additional considerations which, though not so strictly according
  with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of
  swaying him.
</p>
<p>
  To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the
  shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew, for
  example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over
  Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any
  more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for
  to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal
  relation. Starbuck&rsquo;s body and Starbuck&rsquo;s coerced will were Ahab&rsquo;s, so long
  as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck&rsquo;s brain; still he knew that for all
  this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain&rsquo;s quest, and could
  he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It
  might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen.
  During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open
  relapses of rebellion against his captain&rsquo;s leadership, unless some
  ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon
  him. Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick
  was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and
  shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some
  way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally
  invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn
  into the obscure background (for few men&rsquo;s courage is proof against
  protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their
  long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to
  think of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage
  crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all
  sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable&mdash;they live in the
  varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness&mdash;and when
  retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however
  promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things
  requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and
  hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.
</p>
<p>
  Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion
  mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.
  The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought
  Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the
  hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even
  breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the
  love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for
  their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and chivalric
  Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of
  land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,
  picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way. Had they
  been strictly held to their one final and romantic object&mdash;that final
  and romantic object, too many would have turned from in disgust. I will
  not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash&mdash;aye, cash.
  They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by, and no perspective
  promise of it to them, and then this same quiescent cash all at once
  mutinying in them, this same cash would soon cashier Ahab.
</p>
<p>
  Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to
  Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat
  prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod&rsquo;s voyage,
  Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid
  himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect
  impunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end
  competent, could refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently
  wrest from him the command. From even the barely hinted imputation of
  usurpation, and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression
  gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect
  himself. That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain
  and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to
  every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to
  be subjected to.
</p>
<p>
  For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally
  developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree
  continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod&rsquo;s voyage;
  observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force himself to
  evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of
  his profession.
</p>
<p>
  Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three
  mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit
  reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.
