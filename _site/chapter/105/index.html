  <h1>
CHAPTER 105. Does the Whale&rsquo;s Magnitude Diminish?&mdash;Will He Perish?
</h1>
<p>
  Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the
  head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether, in the
  long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the original
  bulk of his sires.
</p>
<p>
  But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
  present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found
  in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period prior to
  man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those belonging to
  its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones.
</p>
<p>
  Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
  Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than seventy
  feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the
  tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized
  modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen&rsquo;s authority, that Sperm Whales
  have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture.
</p>
<p>
  But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
  advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it
  not be, that since Adam&rsquo;s time they have degenerated?
</p>
<p>
  Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such
  gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells
  us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others
  which measured eight hundred feet in length&mdash;Rope Walks and Thames
  Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke&rsquo;s
  naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting
  down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one
  hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet. And
  LacÃ©pÃ¨de, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in
  the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one
  hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work was
  published so late as A.D. 1825.
</p>
<p>
  But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is as
  big as his ancestors in Pliny&rsquo;s time. And if ever I go where Pliny is, I,
  a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I
  cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were
  buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not measure so
  much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks; and while the
  cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh
  tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as
  plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield,
  not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh&rsquo;s fat
  kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the
  whale alone should have degenerated.
</p>
<p>
  But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
  recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs
  at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even through
  Behring&rsquo;s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the
  world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental
  coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a
  chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not at last be
  exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man, smoke
  his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.
</p>
<p>
  Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
  which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies
  of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with
  their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals,
  where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch; in such a
  comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that the
  hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.
</p>
<p>
  But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a period
  ago&mdash;not a good lifetime&mdash;the census of the buffalo in Illinois
  exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day
  not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the
  cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far
  different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an
  end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for
  forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank God, if
  at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days of the
  old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when the far
  west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin, the
  same number of moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on
  horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but forty
  thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be
  statistically stated.
</p>
<p>
  Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual
  extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years (the
  latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods,
  were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the
  voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more remunerative.
  Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some
  views to safety, now swim the seas in immense caravans, so that to a large
  degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other
  days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.
  That is all. And equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the
  so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years
  abounding with them, hence that species also is declining. For they are
  only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer
  enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand
  has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two
  firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain
  impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss
  have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades
  of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort to their
  Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls
  there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed circle of
  everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.
</p>
<p>
  But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
  cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
  positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions. But
  though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than 13,000,
  have been annually slain on the nor&rsquo; west coast by the Americans alone;
  yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little
  or no account as an opposing argument in this matter.
</p>
<p>
  Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of
  the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to Harto,
  the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the King of
  Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are numerous as
  droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no reason to
  doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of
  years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive
  monarchs of the East&mdash;if they still survive there in great numbers,
  much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture
  to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both
  Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of the sea
  combined.
</p>

  Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of
  whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more, therefore
  at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations must be
  contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea of, by
  imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of creation
  yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and children who were
  alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this countless host to the
  present human population of the globe.

  Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
  species, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas before
  the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries,
  and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah&rsquo;s flood he despised Noah&rsquo;s
  Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like the Netherlands,
  to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will still survive, and
  rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood, spout his frothed
  defiance to the skies.
