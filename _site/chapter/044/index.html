  <h1>
  CHAPTER 44. The Chart.
</h1>
<p>
  Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
  took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose
  with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and
  bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread them
  before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating himself before it, you
  would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which
  there met his eye; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional
  courses over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, he would refer
  to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down the seasons
  and places in which, on various former voyages of various ships, sperm
  whales had been captured or seen.
</p>
<p>
  While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
  head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw
  shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it
  almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on
  the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and
  courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.
</p>
<p>
  But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
  cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were
  brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others
  were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab
  was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more
  certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.
</p>
<p>
  Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it
  might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
  creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to
  Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating
  the driftings of the sperm whale&rsquo;s food; and, also, calling to mind the
  regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes;
  could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties,
  concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of
  his prey.
</p>
<p>
  So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm
  whale&rsquo;s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could
  he be closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for
  one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the
  migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in
  invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows.
  On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory
  charts of the sperm whale.*
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne
 out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of
 the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By
 that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in
 course of completion; and portions of it are presented in
 the circular. &ldquo;This chart divides the ocean into districts
 of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;
 perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
 columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each
 of which districts are three lines; one to show the number
 of days that have been spent in each month in every
 district, and the two others to show the number of days in
 which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.&rdquo;
</pre>
<p>
  Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the
  sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct&mdash;say, rather, secret
  intelligence from the Deity&mdash;mostly swim in <i>veins</i>, as they are
  called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such
  undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart,
  with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the
  direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor&rsquo;s parallel, and
  though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable,
  straight wake, yet the arbitrary <i>vein</i> in which at these times he is said
  to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width (more or less, as the
  vein is presumed to expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual
  sweep from the whale-ship&rsquo;s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along
  this magic zone. The sum is, that at particular seasons within that
  breadth and along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be
  looked for.
</p>
<p>
  And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
  feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
  the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art,
  so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly
  without prospect of a meeting.
</p>
<p>
  There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
  delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps.
  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for
  particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds
  which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will
  turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the
  preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances
  where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same remark,
  only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among
  the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former
  year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the
  Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow,
  that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent
  corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So, too,
  with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.
  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to
  speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab&rsquo;s chances of
  accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only
  been made to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere
  a particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would
  become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the
  next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were
  conjoined in the one technical phrase&mdash;the Season-on-the-Line. For
  there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been
  periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun,
  in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of
  the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the
  white whale had taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds;
  there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the
  awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and
  unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this
  unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon
  the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to
  those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize
  his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.
</p>
<p>
  Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the
  Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander
  to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running
  down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to
  cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the
  premature hour of the Pequod&rsquo;s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly
  selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of things. Because,
  an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before
  him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would
  spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his
  vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should
  turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or
  China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons,
  Pampas, Nor&rsquo;-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and
  Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the
  Pequod&rsquo;s circumnavigating wake.
</p>
<p>
  But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not
  but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary
  whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual
  recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged
  thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of
  Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And
  have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after
  poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself
  back in reveries&mdash;tallied him, and shall he escape? His broad fins
  are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep&rsquo;s ear! And here, his mad
  mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of
  pondering came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to
  recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man
  endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps
  with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.
</p>
<p>
  Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
  dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the
  day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round
  and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his
  life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the
  case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base, and
  a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and lightnings
  shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them; when
  this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through
  the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as
  though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead
  of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at
  his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at
  such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the
  white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent
  that so caused him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the
  eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time
  dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it
  for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the
  scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was
  no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with
  the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab&rsquo;s case, yielding up
  all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by
  its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils
  into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay, could
  grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was conjoined,
  fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore,
  the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab
  rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless
  somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an
  object to colour, and therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old
  man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense
  thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for
  ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.
