  <h1>
  CHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires.
</h1>
<p>
  The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a
  Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy
  coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard
  as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would
  not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general
  drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is
  famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried
  up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak,
  seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed
  the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensation of the
  man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight
  skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with
  inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck
  seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as
  now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his
  interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into
  his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those
  thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A staid,
  steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of
  action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety
  and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times
  affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest.
  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural
  reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly
  incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in
  some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than
  from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And if
  at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his
  far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend
  him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him
  still further to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted
  men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in
  the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. &ldquo;I will have no man in my
  boat,&rdquo; said Starbuck, &ldquo;who is not afraid of a whale.&rdquo; By this, he seemed
  to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which
  arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an
  utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye, aye,&rdquo; said Stubb, the second mate, &ldquo;Starbuck, there, is as careful a
  man as you&rsquo;ll find anywhere in this fishery.&rdquo; But we shall ere long see
  what that word &ldquo;careful&rdquo; precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or
  almost any other whale hunter.
</p>
<p>
  Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment;
  but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally
  practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business
  of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like
  her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had
  no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in
  fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him. For, thought
  Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living,
  and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been
  so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was his own father&rsquo;s? Where, in
  the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?
</p>
<p>
  With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
  superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which
  could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it
  was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such
  terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that
  these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him, which,
  under suitable circumstances, would break out from its confinement, and
  burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it was that sort of
  bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally
  abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the
  ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more
  terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you from
  the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.
</p>
<p>
  But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
  abasement of poor Starbuck&rsquo;s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to
  write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the
  fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint
  stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;
  men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble and
  so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any ignominious
  blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes.
  That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so far within us, that
  it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone; bleeds with
  keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man. Nor can
  piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings
  against the permitting stars. But this august dignity I treat of, is not
  the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no
  robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick
  or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates
  without end from God; Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and
  circumference of all democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!
</p>
<p>
  If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall
  hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic
  graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them
  all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch
  that workman&rsquo;s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow
  over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics bear me
  out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one royal
  mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou great
  democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the
  pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of
  finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst
  pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a
  war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all
  Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from
  the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!
