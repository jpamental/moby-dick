  <h1>
  CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.
</h1>
<p>
  I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
  robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon
  admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,
  sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was
  the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a
  very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth,
  but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. At the
  time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy
  old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering
  youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain
  mild gleams of a newly developing bloom&mdash;the spring verdure peeping
  forth even beneath February&rsquo;s snow. No one having previously heard his
  history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost
  interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities
  about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he
  entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come
  in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and
  his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with
  the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and
  overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an
  adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the
  pulpit.
</p>
<p>
  Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
  regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,
  seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it
  seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit
  without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those
  used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain
  had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for
  this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a
  mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel
  it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for an instant at the
  foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of
  the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly
  sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the
  steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.
</p>
<p>
  The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with
  swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood,
  so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the
  pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these
  joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared
  to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and
  stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step,
  till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little
  Quebec.
</p>
<p>
  I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
  Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity,
  that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of
  the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing;
  furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by
  that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for
  the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for
  replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of
  God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold&mdash;a lofty
  Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.
</p>
<p>
  But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
  borrowed from the chaplain&rsquo;s former sea-farings. Between the marble
  cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was
  adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against
  a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers. But
  high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little
  isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel&rsquo;s face; and this bright
  face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship&rsquo;s tossed deck,
  something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory&rsquo;s plank
  where Nelson fell. &ldquo;Ah, noble ship,&rdquo; the angel seemed to say, &ldquo;beat on,
  beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is
  breaking through; the clouds are rolling off&mdash;serenest azure is at
  hand.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had
  achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the
  likeness of a ship&rsquo;s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting
  piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship&rsquo;s fiddle-headed beak.
</p>
<p>
  What could be more full of meaning?&mdash;for the pulpit is ever this
  earth&rsquo;s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads
  the world. From thence it is the storm of God&rsquo;s quick wrath is first
  descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is the
  God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds. Yes,
  the world&rsquo;s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete; and the
  pulpit is its prow.
