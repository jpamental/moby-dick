  <h1>
  CHAPTER 58. Brit.
</h1>
<p>
  Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows of
  brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale largely
  feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we seemed to
  be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.
</p>
<p>
  On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from the
  attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam
  through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous
  Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated from the
  water that escaped at the lip.
</p>
<p>
  As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their
  scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these monsters
  swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving behind them
  endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*
</p>
<p>
  *That part of the sea known among whalemen as the &ldquo;Brazil Banks&rdquo; does not
  bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there being
  shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable meadow-like
  appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in
  those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.
</p>
<p>
  But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all
  reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they
  paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked more
  like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the great
  hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass
  on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such, taking
  them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him,
  who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea.
  And even when recognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very
  hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly
  be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that lives in a dog
  or a horse.
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep
  with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though some old
  naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their
  kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this
  may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the
  ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious
  kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect
  be said to bear comparative analogy to him.
</p>
<p>
  But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas
  have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling;
  though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that
  Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one
  superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of all
  mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and
  hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters; though but a
  moment&rsquo;s consideration will teach, that however baby man may brag of his
  science and skill, and however much, in a flattering future, that science
  and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom,
  the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest, stiffest
  frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of these
  very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea
  which aboriginally belongs to it.
</p>
<p>
  The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
  vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.
  That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of
  last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah&rsquo;s flood is not yet subsided; two
  thirds of the fair world it yet covers.
</p>
<p>
  Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
  miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,
  when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and
  swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in
  precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.
</p>
<p>
  But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is
  also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who
  murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath
  spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own
  cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and
  leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No mercy,
  no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad battle
  steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the globe.
</p>
<p>
  Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide
  under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden
  beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish
  brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the
  dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more,
  the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each
  other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.
</p>
<p>
  Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile
  earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a
  strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean
  surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular
  Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the
  half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou canst
  never return!
