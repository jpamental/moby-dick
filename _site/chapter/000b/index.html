</h2>
<p>
  It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a
  poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans
  and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to
  whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane.
  Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the
  higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these
  extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the
  ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these
  extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing
  bird&rsquo;s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied,
  and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our
  own.
</p>
<p>
  So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou
  belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world
  will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong;
  but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too;
  and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes
  and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness&mdash;Give
  it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains ye take to please the
  world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless! Would that I
  could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down
  your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for your
  friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens,
  and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael,
  against your coming. Here ye strike but splintered hearts together&mdash;there,
  ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses!

  will be aground in twelve or thirteen feet water.&rdquo; &mdash;<i>Thomas Edge&rsquo;s
  Ten Voyages to Spitzbergen, in Purchas</i>.

  Jonas-in-the-Whale.... Some say the whale can&rsquo;t open his mouth, but that
  is a fable.... They frequently climb up the masts to see whether they
  can see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his pains....
  I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above a barrel of
  herrings in his belly.... One of our harpooneers told me that he caught

  whale, in order to avoid being seen by us.&rdquo; &mdash;<i>Cook&rsquo;s Voyages</i>.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The larger whales, they seldom venture to attack. They stand in so
  great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to

  some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order to
  terrify and prevent their too near approach.&rdquo; &mdash;<i>Uno Von Troil&rsquo;s

&ldquo;In the free element beneath me swam,
Floundered and dived, in play, in chace, in battle,
Fishes of every colour, form, and kind;
Which language cannot paint, and mariner
Had never seen; from dread Leviathan
To insect millions peopling every wave:
Gather&rsquo;d in shoals immense, like floating islands,
Led by mysterious instincts through that waste
And trackless region, though on every side
Assaulted by voracious enemies,
Whales, sharks, and monsters, arm&rsquo;d in front or jaw,
With swords, saws, spiral horns, or hooked fangs.&rdquo;

  &ldquo;Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks, the
  infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous head,
  and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him; he rushes at
  the boats with his head; they are propelled before him with vast
  swiftness, and sometimes utterly destroyed.... It is a matter of great
  astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting,
  and, in a commercial point of view, so important an animal (as the Sperm
  Whale) should have been so entirely neglected, or should have excited so
  little curiosity among the numerous, and many of them competent
  observers, that of late years, must have possessed the most abundant and
  the most convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes.&rdquo;

  &ldquo;The Cachalot&rdquo; (Sperm Whale) &ldquo;is not only better armed than the True
  Whale&rdquo; (Greenland or Right Whale) &ldquo;in possessing a formidable weapon at
  either extremity of its body, but also more frequently displays a
  disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in manner at once so
  artful, bold, and mischievous, as to lead to its being regarded as the
  most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the whale tribe.&rdquo;
