  <h1>
  Extracts.
</h1>
<h2>
  (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).
</h2>
<p>
  It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a
  poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans
  and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to
  whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane.
  Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the
  higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these
  extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the
  ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these
  extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing
  bird&rsquo;s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied,
  and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our
  own.
</p>
<p>
  So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou
  belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world
  will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong;
  but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too;
  and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes
  and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness&mdash;Give
  it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains ye take to please the
  world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless! Would that I
  could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down
  your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for your
  friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens,
  and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael,
  against your coming. Here ye strike but splintered hearts together&mdash;there,
  ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses!
