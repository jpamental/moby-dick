<h3>
  The Deck&mdash;First Night Watch.
</h3>
<p>
  (<i>Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two
  lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is firmly
  fixed in the vice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws, and
  various tools of all sorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red flame
  of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work.</i>)
</p>
<p>
  Drat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft, and
  that is soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and
  shinbones. Let&rsquo;s try another. Aye, now, this works better (<i>sneezes</i>).
  Halloa, this bone dust is (<i>sneezes</i>)&mdash;why it&rsquo;s (<i>sneezes</i>)&mdash;yes
  it&rsquo;s (<i>sneezes</i>)&mdash;bless my soul, it won&rsquo;t let me speak! This is what an
  old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tree, and you
  don&rsquo;t get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don&rsquo;t get it (<i>sneezes</i>).
  Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and let&rsquo;s have that ferule
  and buckle-screw; I&rsquo;ll be ready for them presently. Lucky now (<i>sneezes</i>)
  there&rsquo;s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle a little; but a mere
  shinbone&mdash;why it&rsquo;s easy as making hop-poles; only I should like to
  put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn
  him out as neat a leg now as ever (<i>sneezes</i>) scraped to a lady in a parlor.
  Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I&rsquo;ve seen in shop windows wouldn&rsquo;t
  compare at all. They soak water, they do; and of course get rheumatic, and
  have to be doctored (<i>sneezes</i>) with washes and lotions, just like live
  legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and
  see whether the length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess.
  Ha! that&rsquo;s the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it&rsquo;s somebody else,
  that&rsquo;s certain.
</p>
<p>
  AHAB (<i>advancing</i>). (<i>During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues
  sneezing at times.</i>)
</p>
<p>
  Well, manmaker!
</p>
<p>
  Just in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length. Let
  me measure, sir.
</p>
<p>
  Measured for a leg! good. Well, it&rsquo;s not the first time. About it! There;
  keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here, carpenter;
  let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.
</p>
<p>
  Oh, sir, it will break bones&mdash;beware, beware!
</p>
<p>
  No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery
  world that can hold, man. What&rsquo;s Prometheus about there?&mdash;the
  blacksmith, I mean&mdash;what&rsquo;s he about?
</p>
<p>
  He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.
</p>
<p>
  Right. It&rsquo;s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a fierce
  red flame there!
</p>
<p>
  Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.
</p>
<p>
  Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old
  Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith,
  and animated them with fire; for what&rsquo;s made in fire must properly belong
  to fire; and so hell&rsquo;s probable. How the soot flies! This must be the
  remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter, when he&rsquo;s through
  with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder-blades;
  there&rsquo;s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.
</p>
<p>
  Sir?
</p>
<p>
  Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I&rsquo;ll order a complete man after a
  desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest
  modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to &rsquo;em, to stay in
  one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all, brass
  forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let me see&mdash;shall
  I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on top of his head
  to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.
</p>
<p>
  Now, what&rsquo;s he speaking about, and who&rsquo;s he speaking to, I should like to
  know? Shall I keep standing here? (<i>aside</i>).
</p>
<p>
  &rsquo;Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here&rsquo;s one. No,
  no, no; I must have a lantern.
</p>
<p>
  Ho, ho! That&rsquo;s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.
</p>
<p>
  What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man? Thrusted
  light is worse than presented pistols.
</p>
<p>
  I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.
</p>
<p>
  Carpenter? why that&rsquo;s&mdash;but no;&mdash;a very tidy, and, I may say, an
  extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;&mdash;or
  would&rsquo;st thou rather work in clay?
</p>
<p>
  Sir?&mdash;Clay? clay, sir? That&rsquo;s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.
</p>
<p>
  The fellow&rsquo;s impious! What art thou sneezing about?
</p>
<p>
  Bone is rather dusty, sir.
</p>
<p>
  Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under
  living people&rsquo;s noses.
</p>
<p>
  Sir?&mdash;oh! ah!&mdash;I guess so;&mdash;yes&mdash;oh, dear!
</p>
<p>
  Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good
  workmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for thy
  work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall nevertheless
  feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that is, carpenter,
  my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst thou not drive
  that old Adam away?
</p>
<p>
  Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard
  something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
  entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still pricking
  him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?
</p>
<p>
  It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was;
  so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the soul.
  Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a hair,
  do I. Is&rsquo;t a riddle?
</p>
<p>
  I should humbly call it a poser, sir.
</p>
<p>
  Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing
  may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where
  thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most
  solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don&rsquo;t speak!
  And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long
  dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of
  hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!
</p>
<p>
  Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again; I
  think I didn&rsquo;t carry a small figure, sir.
</p>
<p>
  Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.&mdash;How long before
  the leg is done?
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps an hour, sir.
</p>
<p>
  Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (<i>turns to go</i>). Oh, Life! Here I
  am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a
  bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not
  do away with ledgers. I would be free as air; and I&rsquo;m down in the whole
  world&rsquo;s books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with the
  wealthiest PrÃ¦torians at the auction of the Roman empire (which was the
  world&rsquo;s); and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with. By
  heavens! I&rsquo;ll get a crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one
  small, compendious vertebra. So.
</p>
<p>
  CARPENTER (<i>resuming his work</i>).
</p>
<p>
  Well, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says he&rsquo;s
  queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer; he&rsquo;s queer,
  says Stubb; he&rsquo;s queer&mdash;queer, queer; and keeps dinning it into Mr.
  Starbuck all the time&mdash;queer&mdash;sir&mdash;queer, queer, very
  queer. And here&rsquo;s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here&rsquo;s his
  bedfellow! has a stick of whale&rsquo;s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his
  leg; he&rsquo;ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in
  three places, and all three places standing in one hell&mdash;how was
  that? Oh! I don&rsquo;t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I&rsquo;m a sort of
  strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that&rsquo;s only haphazard-like.
  Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out
  into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you
  under the chin pretty quick, and there&rsquo;s a great cry for life-boats. And
  here&rsquo;s the heron&rsquo;s leg! long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most folks
  one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they use them
  mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old
  coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he&rsquo;s a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to
  death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the
  cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and
  let&rsquo;s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his
  horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round collecting old
  beer barrels, to fill &rsquo;em up again. What a leg this is! It looks like a
  real live leg, filed down to nothing but the core; he&rsquo;ll be standing on
  this to-morrow; he&rsquo;ll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot
  the little oval slate, smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude.
  So, so; chisel, file, and sand-paper, now!
