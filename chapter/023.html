<p>
  Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
  mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.
</p>
<p>
  When on that shivering winter&rsquo;s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive
  bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her helm
  but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the
  man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years&rsquo; dangerous voyage,
  could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term.
  The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the
  unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is
  the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him
  as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward
  land. The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is
  safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that&rsquo;s
  kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that
  ship&rsquo;s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,
  though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through.
  With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights
  &rsquo;gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the
  lashed sea&rsquo;s landlessness again; for refuge&rsquo;s sake forlornly rushing into
  peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!
</p>
<p>
  Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
  intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid
  effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the
  wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous,
  slavish shore?
</p>
<p>
  But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite
  as God&mdash;so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be
  ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like,
  then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all
  this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee
  grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing&mdash;straight
  up, leaps thy apotheosis!
