<p>
  &ldquo;HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a
  cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the
  scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the buckets to
  fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed
  precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle
  their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence,
  only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the
  unceasingly advancing keel.
</p>
<p>
  It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon, whose
  post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a Cholo, the
  words above.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;There it is again&mdash;under the hatches&mdash;don&rsquo;t you hear it&mdash;a
  cough&mdash;it sounded like a cough.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;There again&mdash;there it is!&mdash;it sounds like two or three sleepers
  turning over, now!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It&rsquo;s the three soaked biscuits ye
  eat for supper turning over inside of ye&mdash;nothing else. Look to the
  bucket!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Say what ye will, shipmate; I&rsquo;ve sharp ears.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye, you are the chap, ain&rsquo;t ye, that heard the hum of the old
  Quakeress&rsquo;s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you&rsquo;re the
  chap.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Grin away; we&rsquo;ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody
  down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I suspect
  our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell Flask, one
  morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the wind.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Tish! the bucket!&rdquo;
 </p>
