<p>
  &ldquo;Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from the
  water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the above
  words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us, levelled his
  massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but shabbily
  apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a black
  handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all
  directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed
  bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Have ye shipped in her?&rdquo; he repeated.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,&rdquo; said I, trying to gain a little
  more time for an uninterrupted look at him.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye, the Pequod&mdash;that ship there,&rdquo; he said, drawing back his whole
  arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed
  bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we have just signed the articles.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Anything down there about your souls?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Oh, perhaps you hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got any,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;No matter though, I
  know many chaps that hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got any,&mdash;good luck to &rsquo;em; and they are
  all the better off for it. A soul&rsquo;s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What are you jabbering about, shipmate?&rdquo; said I.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s</i> got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in
  other chaps,&rdquo; abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon
  the word <i>he</i>.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Queequeg,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go; this fellow has broken loose from
  somewhere; he&rsquo;s talking about something and somebody we don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried the stranger. &ldquo;Ye said true&mdash;ye hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t seen Old
  Thunder yet, have ye?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Old Thunder?&rdquo; said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness of
  his manner.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Captain Ahab.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
  seen him yet, have ye?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;No, we hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be
  all right again before long.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;All right again before long!&rdquo; laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
  derisive sort of laugh. &ldquo;Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then
  this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What do you know about him?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What did they <i>tell</i> you about him? Say that!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t tell much of anything about him; only I&rsquo;ve heard that he&rsquo;s a
  good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s true&mdash;yes, both true enough. But you must jump
  when he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go&mdash;that&rsquo;s the word
  with Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off
  Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;
  nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in
  Santa?&mdash;heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver
  calabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage,
  according to the prophecy. Didn&rsquo;t ye hear a word about them matters and
  something more, eh? No, I don&rsquo;t think ye did; how could ye? Who knows it?
  Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows&rsquo;ever, mayhap, ye&rsquo;ve heard tell about
  the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say. Oh
  yes, <i>that</i> every one knows a&rsquo;most&mdash;I mean they know he&rsquo;s only one leg;
  and that a parmacetti took the other off.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what all this gibberish of yours is about, I don&rsquo;t
  know, and I don&rsquo;t much care; for it seems to me that you must be a little
  damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship
  there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about the loss of
  his leg.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;<i>All</i> about it, eh&mdash;sure you do?&mdash;all?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Pretty sure.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
  stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
  little, turned and said:&mdash;&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the
  papers? Well, well, what&rsquo;s signed, is signed; and what&rsquo;s to be, will be;
  and then again, perhaps it won&rsquo;t be, after all. Anyhow, it&rsquo;s all fixed and
  arranged a&rsquo;ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I suppose;
  as well these as any other men, God pity &rsquo;em! Morning to ye, shipmates,
  morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I&rsquo;m sorry I stopped ye.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Look here, friend,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you have anything important to tell us,
  out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are mistaken
  in your game; that&rsquo;s all I have to say.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way; you
  are just the man for him&mdash;the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates,
  morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell &rsquo;em I&rsquo;ve concluded not to make one of
  &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Ah, my dear fellow, you can&rsquo;t fool us that way&mdash;you can&rsquo;t fool us.
  It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a
  great secret in him.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Morning it is,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Come along, Queequeg, let&rsquo;s leave this crazy
  man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Elijah.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each other&rsquo;s
  fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was nothing but a
  humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps above a
  hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did
  so, who should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance.
  Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of
  his being behind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether
  the stranger would turn the same corner that we did. He did; and then it
  seemed to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could not for
  the life of me imagine. This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous,
  half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all
  kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all connected with
  the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn
  fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when
  I left the ship the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig;
  and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy
  things.
</p>
<p>
  I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really
  dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and
  on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without
  seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it
  seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.
