<p>
  Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went
  rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually
  reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly
  cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as
  crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up&mdash;flaked up, with
  rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in
  jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their
  absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping man, &rsquo;twas
  hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights. But all
  the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and
  potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the soul,
  especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her
  crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these
  subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab&rsquo;s texture.

<p>
  Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
  man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders, the
  old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked
  deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to
  live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits were more to the
  cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. &ldquo;It feels like going down into
  one&rsquo;s tomb,&rdquo;&mdash;he would mutter to himself&mdash;&ldquo;for an old captain
  like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug
  berth.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
  set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and
  when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it
  not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its
  place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when this sort of
  steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman
  would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge,
  gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way. Some considering
  touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually
  abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,
  seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been
  the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams would
  have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was on him
  too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was
  measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate,
  came up from below, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness,
  hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one
  could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting
  something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the
  insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab
  then.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,&rdquo; said Ahab, &ldquo;that thou wouldst wad me that
  fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave; where
  such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last.&mdash;Down,
  dog, and kennel!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
  scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, &ldquo;I
  am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like
  it, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away, as
  if to avoid some passionate temptation.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;No, sir; not yet,&rdquo; said Stubb, emboldened, &ldquo;I will not tamely be called a
  dog, sir.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or
  I&rsquo;ll clear the world of thee!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in
  his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,&rdquo; muttered
  Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very queer.
  Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don&rsquo;t well know whether to go back and strike
  him, or&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&mdash;down here on my knees and pray for him?
  Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the first time
  I ever <em>did</em> pray. It&rsquo;s queer; very queer; and he&rsquo;s queer too; aye, take him
  fore and aft, he&rsquo;s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How
  he flashed at me!&mdash;his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway
  there&rsquo;s something on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a
  deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours
  out of the twenty-four; and he don&rsquo;t sleep then. Didn&rsquo;t that Dough-Boy,
  the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man&rsquo;s
  hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot,
  and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of
  frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I
  guess he&rsquo;s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it&rsquo;s a kind of
  Tic-Dolly-row they say&mdash;worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don&rsquo;t
  know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He&rsquo;s full of
  riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as
  Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what&rsquo;s that for, I should like to know?
  Who&rsquo;s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain&rsquo;t that queer, now? But
  there&rsquo;s no telling, it&rsquo;s the old game&mdash;Here goes for a snooze. Damn
  me, it&rsquo;s worth a fellow&rsquo;s while to be born into the world, if only to fall
  right asleep. And now that I think of it, that&rsquo;s about the first thing
  babies do, and that&rsquo;s a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are
  queer, come to think of &rsquo;em. But that&rsquo;s against my principles. Think not,
  is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth&mdash;So
  here goes again. But how&rsquo;s that? didn&rsquo;t he call me a dog? blazes! he
  called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of <em>that!</em>
  He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he <em>did</em> kick me,
  and I didn&rsquo;t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow.
  It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil&rsquo;s the matter with me? I
  don&rsquo;t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of
  turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though&mdash;How?
  how? how?&mdash;but the only way&rsquo;s to stash it; so here goes to hammock
  again; and in the morning, I&rsquo;ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over
  by daylight.&rdquo;
