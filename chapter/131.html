title: CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.

<p>
  The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
  life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably
  misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed
  upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross
  the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the
  spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.
</p>
<p>
  Upon the stranger&rsquo;s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some
  few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw
  through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,
  half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Hast seen the White Whale?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with his
  trumpet he pointed to the wreck.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Hast killed him?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,&rdquo; answered the
  other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered
  sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Not forged!&rdquo; and snatching Perth&rsquo;s levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab
  held it out, exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I
  hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these
  barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin,
  where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Then God keep thee, old man&mdash;see&rsquo;st thou that&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the
  hammock&mdash;&ldquo;I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
  yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only <i>that</i> one I bury; the rest were
  buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.&rdquo; Then turning to his
  crew&mdash;&ldquo;Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and lift
  the body; so, then&mdash;Oh! God&rdquo;&mdash;advancing towards the hammock with
  uplifted hands&mdash;&ldquo;may the resurrection and the life&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Brace forward! Up helm!&rdquo; cried Ahab like lightning to his men.
</p>
<p>
  But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound
  of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so
  quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled
  her hull with their ghostly baptism.
</p>
<p>
  As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
  hanging at the Pequod&rsquo;s stern came into conspicuous relief.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!&rdquo; cried a foreboding voice in her wake. &ldquo;In
  vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your
  taffrail to show us your coffin!&rdquo;
