<p>
  It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were hardly
  separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was
  transparently pure and soft, with a woman&rsquo;s look, and the robust and
  man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson&rsquo;s chest
  in his sleep.
</p>
<p>
  Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
  unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air; but
  to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty
  leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong, troubled,
  murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.
</p>
<p>
  But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and
  shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,
  that distinguished them.
</p>
<p>
  Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air
  to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the girdling
  line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion&mdash;most seen here at
  the equator&mdash;denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms,
  with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.
</p>
<p>
  Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and
  unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of
  ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting
  his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl&rsquo;s forehead of heaven.
</p>
<p>
  Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged
  creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how
  oblivious were ye of old Ahab&rsquo;s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen
  little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around
  their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the
  marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.
</p>
<p>
  Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and
  watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more
  and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the lovely
  aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the
  cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did
  at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world, so long cruel&mdash;forbidding&mdash;now
  threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously
  sob over him, as if over one, that however wilful and erring, she could
  yet find it in her heart to save and to bless. From beneath his slouched
  hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such
  wealth as that one wee drop.
</p>
<p>
  Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;
  and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that
  stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch him,
  or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood there.
</p>
<p>
  Ahab turned.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Starbuck!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Sir.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such a
  day&mdash;very much such a sweetness as this&mdash;I struck my first whale&mdash;a
  boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty&mdash;forty&mdash;forty years ago!&mdash;ago!
  Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and
  storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab
  forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors of
  the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not spent
  three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the desolation of
  solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain&rsquo;s
  exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the
  green country without&mdash;oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery
  of solitary command!&mdash;when I think of all this; only half-suspected,
  not so keenly known to me before&mdash;and how for forty years I have fed
  upon dry salted fare&mdash;fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!&mdash;when
  the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the
  world&rsquo;s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts&mdash;away, whole oceans away,
  from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn
  the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow&mdash;wife? wife?&mdash;rather
  a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I
  married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling
  blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab
  has furiously, foamingly chased his prey&mdash;more a demon than a man!&mdash;aye,
  aye! what a forty years&rsquo; fool&mdash;fool&mdash;old fool, has old Ahab
  been! Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the
  oar, and the iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now?
  Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear,
  one poor leg should have been snatched from under me? Here, brush this old
  hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never
  grow but from out some ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old,
  Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam,
  staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!&mdash;crack
  my heart!&mdash;stave my brain!&mdash;mockery! mockery! bitter, biting
  mockery of grey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and
  feel thus intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look
  into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than
  to gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is
  the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;
  stay on board, on board!&mdash;lower not when I do; when branded Ahab
  gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with
  the far away home I see in that eye!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why
  should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us fly
  these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are Starbuck&rsquo;s&mdash;wife
  and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth; even as thine,
  sir, are the wife and child of thy loving, longing, paternal old age!
  Away! let us away!&mdash;this instant let me alter the course! How
  cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl on our way to see
  old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some such mild blue days,
  even as this, in Nantucket.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;They have, they have. I have seen them&mdash;some summer days in the
  morning. About this time&mdash;yes, it is his noon nap now&mdash;the boy
  vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
  cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back to
  dance him again.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every morning,
  should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father&rsquo;s
  sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket! Come, my
  Captain, study out the course, and let us away! See, see! the boy&rsquo;s face
  from the window! the boy&rsquo;s hand on the hill!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  But Ahab&rsquo;s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and
  cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
  cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands
  me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and
  crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly making me ready
  to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not so much as dare?
  Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm? But if the great
  sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single
  star can revolve, but by some invisible power; how then can this one small
  heart beat; this one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that
  beating, does that thinking, does that living, and not I. By heaven, man,
  we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and
  Fate is the handspike. And all the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this
  unsounded sea! Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him to chase and
  fang that flying-fish? Where do murderers go, man! Who&rsquo;s to doom, when the
  judge himself is dragged to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a
  mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away
  meadow; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes,
  Starbuck, and the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping?
  Aye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye,
  and rust amid greenness; as last year&rsquo;s scythes flung down, and left in
  the half-cut swaths&mdash;Starbuck!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  But blanched to a corpse&rsquo;s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.
</p>
<p>
  Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at two
  reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly
  leaning over the same rail.
