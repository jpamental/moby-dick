  &ldquo;We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working loose
  and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I&rsquo;d sway them up now.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Sir!&mdash;in God&rsquo;s name!&mdash;sir?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Well.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises,
  but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.&mdash;By
  masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some coasting
  smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest trucks were
  made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now sails amid the
  cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards send down their
  brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh aloft there! I would e&rsquo;en
  take it for sublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady. Oh,
  take medicine, take medicine!&rdquo;
