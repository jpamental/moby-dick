  &ldquo;AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE&rdquo; Job.
</h3>
<p>
  The drama&rsquo;s done. Why then here does any one step forth?&mdash;Because one
  did survive the wreck.
</p>
<p>
  It so chanced, that after the Parsee&rsquo;s disappearance, I was he whom the
  Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab&rsquo;s bowsman, when that bowsman
  assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men
  were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So, floating
  on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the
  halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly,
  drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a
  creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the
  button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like
  another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital centre, the black
  bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring,
  and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin
  life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.
  Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on
  a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with
  padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks.
  On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It
  was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her
  missing children, only found another orphan.
