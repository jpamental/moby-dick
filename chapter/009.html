<p>
  Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
  the scattered people to condense. &ldquo;Starboard gangway, there! side away to
  larboard&mdash;larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a still
  slighter shuffling of women&rsquo;s shoes, and all was quiet again, and every
  eye on the preacher.
</p>
<p>
  He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit&rsquo;s bows, folded his large
  brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a
  prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom
  of the sea.
</p>
<p>
  This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a
  bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog&mdash;in such tones he
  commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards the
  concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy&mdash;
</p>
<blockquote class="bq--quiet bq--inline"> 
  <p>The ribs and terrors in the whale,<br />
  Arched over me a dismal gloom,<br />
  While all God&rsquo;s sun-lit waves rolled by,<br />
  And lift me deepening down to doom.<br />
  <br />
  I saw the opening maw of hell,<br />
  With endless pains and sorrows there;<br />
  Which none but they that feel can tell&mdash;<br />
  Oh, I was plunging to despair.<br />
  <br />
  In black distress, I called my God,<br />
  When I could scarce believe him mine,<br />
  He bowed his ear to my complaints&mdash;<br />
  No more the whale did me confine.<br />
  <br />
  With speed he flew to my relief,<br />
  As on a radiant dolphin borne;<br />
  Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone<br />
  The face of my Deliverer God.<br />
  <br />
  My song for ever shall record<br />
  That terrible, that joyful hour;<br />
  I give the glory to my God,<br />
  His all the mercy and the power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
  howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned
  over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the
  proper page, said: &ldquo;Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first
  chapter of Jonah&mdash;&lsquo;And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up
  Jonah.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters&mdash;four yarns&mdash;is
  one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet
  what depths of the soul does Jonah&rsquo;s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant
  lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the
  fish&rsquo;s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods
  surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters;
  sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But <em>what</em> is this lesson
  that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a
  lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the
  living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story
  of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift
  punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of
  Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was
  in his wilful disobedience of the command of God&mdash;never mind now what
  that command was, or how conveyed&mdash;which he found a hard command. But
  all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do&mdash;remember
  that&mdash;and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade.
  And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this
  disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God,
  by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will carry
  him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this
  earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that&rsquo;s bound
  for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By
  all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz.
  That&rsquo;s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is
  in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed
  in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.
  Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast
  of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two
  thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of
  Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee
  world-wide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of
  all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God;
  prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the
  seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been
  policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong,
  had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he&rsquo;s a fugitive! no
  baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,&mdash;no friends accompany
  him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he
  finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he
  steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the
  moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger&rsquo;s evil eye.
  Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in
  vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the
  mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way,
  one whispers to the other&mdash;&ldquo;Jack, he&rsquo;s robbed a widow;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Joe, do
  you mark him; he&rsquo;s a bigamist;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Harry lad, I guess he&rsquo;s the adulterer
  that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers
  from Sodom.&rdquo; Another runs to read the bill that&rsquo;s stuck against the spile
  upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold
  coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of
  his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his
  sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands
  upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his
  face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself
  suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of
  it; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised,
  they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out
  his papers for the Customs&mdash;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; Oh! how that harmless
  question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But
  he rallies. &lsquo;I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye,
  sir?&rsquo; Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man
  now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than
  he darts a scrutinizing glance. &lsquo;We sail with the next coming tide,&rsquo; at
  last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. &lsquo;No sooner, sir?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Soon
  enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.&rsquo; Ha! Jonah, that&rsquo;s
  another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
  sail with ye,&rsquo;&mdash;he says,&mdash;&lsquo;the passage money how much is that?&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
  pay now.&rsquo; For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing
  not to be overlooked in this history, &lsquo;that he paid the fare thereof&rsquo; ere
  the craft did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Now Jonah&rsquo;s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime
  in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this
  world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a
  passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So
  Jonah&rsquo;s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah&rsquo;s purse, ere he judge
  him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it&rsquo;s assented to.
  Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time
  resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when Jonah
  fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.
  He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he
  mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. &lsquo;Point out my state-room,
  Sir,&rsquo; says Jonah now, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m travel-weary; I need sleep.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou lookest like
  it,&rsquo; says the Captain, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s thy room.&rsquo; Jonah enters, and would lock
  the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling
  there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about
  the doors of convicts&rsquo; cells being never allowed to be locked within. All
  dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds
  the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is
  close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath
  the ship&rsquo;s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that
  stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his
  bowels&rsquo; wards.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates
  in Jonah&rsquo;s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the
  weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in
  slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the
  room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious
  the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens
  Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and
  this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.
  But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor,
  the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. &lsquo;Oh! so my conscience hangs in
  me!&rsquo; he groans, &lsquo;straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my
  soul are all in crookedness!&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still
  reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the
  Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as
  one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish,
  praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the
  whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who
  bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there&rsquo;s naught to
  staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah&rsquo;s prodigy of
  ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and
  from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,
  glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers!
  the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked
  burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break. But now when
  the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars
  are clattering overboard; when the wind is shrieking, and the men are
  yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah&rsquo;s
  head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees
  no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little
  hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with
  open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone
  down into the sides of the ship&mdash;a berth in the cabin as I have taken
  it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and
  shrieks in his dead ear, &lsquo;What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!&rsquo; Startled
  from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and
  stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at
  that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the
  bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy
  vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning
  while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face
  from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the
  rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again
  towards the tormented deep.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing
  attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark
  him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last,
  fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven,
  they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was
  upon them. The lot is Jonah&rsquo;s; that discovered, then how furiously they
  mob him with their questions. &lsquo;What is thine occupation? Whence comest
  thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior
  of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from;
  whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise
  another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer
  is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;&lsquo;I am a Hebrew,&rsquo; he cries&mdash;and then&mdash;&lsquo;I fear the Lord the God
  of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!&rsquo; Fear him, O Jonah? Aye,
  well mightest thou fear the Lord God <em>then!</em> Straightway, he now goes on to
  make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more
  appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating God
  for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts,&mdash;when
  wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the
  sea, for he knew that for <em>his</em> sake this great tempest was upon them; they
  mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship. But
  all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised
  invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of
  Jonah.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when
  instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still,
  as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He
  goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he
  scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws
  awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many
  white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the
  fish&rsquo;s belly. But observe his prayer, and learn a weighty lesson. For
  sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He
  feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance
  to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and
  pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is
  true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for
  punishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in
  the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I
  do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him
  before you as a model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to
  repent of it like Jonah.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting
  storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when
  describing Jonah&rsquo;s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep
  chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring
  elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy
  brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look
  on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.
</p>
<p>
  There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves
  of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed
  eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.
</p>
<p>
  But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,
  with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words:
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon
  me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah
  teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I
  am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from
  this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as
  you listen, while some one of you reads <em>me</em> that other and more awful
  lesson which Jonah teaches to <em>me</em>, as a pilot of the living God. How being
  an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and bidden by the
  Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh,
  Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission,
  and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa. But God
  is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon
  him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with
  swift slantings tore him along &lsquo;into the midst of the seas,&rsquo; where the
  eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and &lsquo;the weeds were
  wrapped about his head,&rsquo; and all the watery world of woe bowled over him.
  Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet&mdash;&lsquo;out of the belly of
  hell&rsquo;&mdash;when the whale grounded upon the ocean&rsquo;s utmost bones, even
  then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God
  spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the
  sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and
  all the delights of air and earth; and &lsquo;vomited out Jonah upon the dry
  land;&rsquo; when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised
  and beaten&mdash;his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously
  murmuring of the ocean&mdash;Jonah did the Almighty&rsquo;s bidding. And what
  was that, shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That
  was it!
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the
  living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel
  duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed
  them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal! Woe
  to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe to him who, in
  this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would not be true, even
  though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot
  Paul has it, while preaching to others is himself a castaway!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his face
  to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a
  heavenly enthusiasm,&mdash;&ldquo;But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of
  every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,
  than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than the
  kelson is low? Delight is to him&mdash;a far, far upward, and inward
  delight&mdash;who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth,
  ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong
  arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has
  gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the
  truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from
  under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,&mdash;top-gallant delight
  is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is
  only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the
  billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure
  Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who
  coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath&mdash;O Father!&mdash;chiefly
  known to me by Thy rod&mdash;mortal or immortal, here I die. I have
  striven to be Thine, more than to be this world&rsquo;s, or mine own. Yet this
  is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he should live
  out the lifetime of his God?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with
  his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed, and
  he was left alone in the place.
</p>
