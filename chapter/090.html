  &ldquo;De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.&rdquo; <em>Bracton,
  l. 3, c. 3.</em>
</p>
<p>
  Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the
  context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
  that land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,
  and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division which,
  in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no intermediate
  remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to this day in force
  in England; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly
  touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in
  a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle that prompts the
  English railways to be at the expense of a separate car, specially
  reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first place, in curious
  proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force, I
  proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two
  years.
</p>
<p>
  It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one of
  the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching
  a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore.
  Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a
  sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden. Holding the office
  directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal emoluments incident to
  the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his. By some writers this
  office is called a sinecure. But not so. Because the Lord Warden is busily
  employed at times in fobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by
  virtue of that same fobbing of them.
</p>
<p>
  Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
  trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat
  fish high and dry, promising themselves a good Â£150 from the precious oil
  and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale
  with their cronies, upon the strength of their respective shares; up steps
  a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman, with a copy of
  Blackstone under his arm; and laying it upon the whale&rsquo;s head, he says&mdash;&ldquo;Hands
  off! this fish, my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord
  Warden&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation&mdash;so
  truly English&mdash;knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching
  their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the
  stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the
  hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At length
  one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made bold to
  speak,
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The Duke.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;It is his.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all
  that to go to the Duke&rsquo;s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our pains
  but our blisters?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;It is his.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
  getting a livelihood?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;It is his.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of this
  whale.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;It is his.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;It is his.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
  Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular
  lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
  deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman of
  the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to take
  the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To which
  my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published) that he
  had already done so, and received the money, and would be obliged to the
  reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend gentleman) would
  decline meddling with other people&rsquo;s business. Is this the still militant
  old man, standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands
  coercing alms of beggars?
</p>
<p>
  It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to
  the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs inquire
  then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that
  right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon gives us the
  reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs to the King and
  Queen, &ldquo;because of its superior excellence.&rdquo; And by the soundest
  commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters.
</p>
<p>
  But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason
  for that, ye lawyers!
</p>
<p>
  In his treatise on &ldquo;Queen-Gold,&rdquo; or Queen-pinmoney, an old King&rsquo;s Bench
  author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: &ldquo;Ye tail is ye Queen&rsquo;s, that
  ye Queen&rsquo;s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.&rdquo; Now this was
  written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right
  whale was largely used in ladies&rsquo; bodices. But this same bone is not in
  the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer
  like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be presented with a tail? An
  allegorical meaning may lurk here.
</p>
<p>
  There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers&mdash;the
  whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and
  nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown&rsquo;s ordinary revenue. I
  know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by inference
  it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the
  whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to
  that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be humorously
  grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there seems a reason in
  all things, even in law.
