<p>
  As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg
  carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
  from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and
  furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft,
  unless they previously produced their papers.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?&rdquo; said I, now jumping on the
  bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;he must show his papers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
  behind Peleg&rsquo;s, out of the wigwam. &ldquo;He must show that he&rsquo;s converted. Son
  of darkness,&rdquo; he added, turning to Queequeg, &ldquo;art thou at present in
  communion with any Christian church?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a member of the first Congregational Church.&rdquo; Here be
  it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last
  come to be converted into the churches.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;First Congregational Church,&rdquo; cried Bildad, &ldquo;what! that worships in
  Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman&rsquo;s meeting-house?&rdquo; and so saying, taking out his
  spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and
  putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning
  stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;How long hath he been a member?&rdquo; he then said, turning to me; &ldquo;not very
  long, I rather guess, young man.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peleg, &ldquo;and he hasn&rsquo;t been baptized right either, or it would
  have washed some of that devil&rsquo;s blue off his face.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Do tell, now,&rdquo; cried Bildad, &ldquo;is this Philistine a regular member of
  Deacon Deuteronomy&rsquo;s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it
  every Lord&rsquo;s day.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,&rdquo; said I;
  &ldquo;all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First
  Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said Bildad sternly, &ldquo;thou art skylarking with me&mdash;explain
  thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. &ldquo;I mean, sir, the same ancient
  Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg
  here, and all of us, and every mother&rsquo;s son and soul of us belong; the
  great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world;
  we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no
  ways touching the grand belief; in <i>that</i> we all join hands.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Splice, thou mean&rsquo;st <i>splice</i> hands,&rdquo; cried Peleg, drawing nearer. &ldquo;Young
  man, you&rsquo;d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I
  never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy&mdash;why Father Mapple
  himself couldn&rsquo;t beat it, and he&rsquo;s reckoned something. Come aboard, come
  aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog there&mdash;what&rsquo;s
  that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great anchor, what a
  harpoon he&rsquo;s got there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it
  about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand
  in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the
  bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to
  the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried
  out in some such way as this:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,
  spose him one whale eye, well, den!&rdquo; and taking sharp aim at it, he darted
  the iron right over old Bildad&rsquo;s broad brim, clean across the ship&rsquo;s
  decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, &ldquo;spos-ee him whale-e
  eye; why, dad whale dead.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Quick, Bildad,&rdquo; said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
  vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.
  &ldquo;Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship&rsquo;s papers. We must have
  Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, we&rsquo;ll
  give ye the ninetieth lay, and that&rsquo;s more than ever was given a
  harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
  enrolled among the same ship&rsquo;s company to which I myself belonged.
</p>
<p>
  When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for
  signing, he turned to me and said, &ldquo;I guess, Quohog there don&rsquo;t know how
  to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or
  make thy mark?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part
  in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen,
  copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a
  queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through
  Captain Peleg&rsquo;s obstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood
  something like this:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
  Quohog. his X mark.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,
  and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
  broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one
  entitled &ldquo;The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,&rdquo; placed it in
  Queequeg&rsquo;s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,
  looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, &ldquo;Son of darkness, I must do my
  duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the
  souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I
  sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman. Spurn
  the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind
  thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad&rsquo;s language,
  heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,&rdquo;
   cried Peleg. &ldquo;Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers&mdash;it takes the shark out of &rsquo;em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish.
  There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all
  Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to good.
  He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered
  away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went
  to Davy Jones.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Peleg! Peleg!&rdquo; said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, &ldquo;thou thyself, as
  I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is
  to have the fear of death; how, then, can&rsquo;st thou prate in this ungodly
  guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod
  here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same
  voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did&rsquo;st thou not think of
  Death and the Judgment then?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Hear him, hear him now,&rdquo; cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
  thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,&mdash;&ldquo;hear him, all of ye.
  Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and
  the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting
  thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft.
  Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think about Death
  then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save
  all hands&mdash;how to rig jury-masts&mdash;how to get into the nearest
  port; that was what I was thinking of.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we
  followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who
  were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a
  patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been
  wasted.
