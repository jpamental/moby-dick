<p>
  The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
  windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These last
  three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one could not
  be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side
  all night; and that boat was Ahab&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>
  The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale&rsquo;s spout-hole; and the
  lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon the
  black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which gently
  chafed the whale&rsquo;s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.
</p>
<p>
  Ahab and all his boat&rsquo;s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching
  in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round the
  whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A sound like
  the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of
  Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.
</p>
<p>
  Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and hooped
  round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded
  world. &ldquo;I have dreamed it again,&rdquo; said he.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin
  can be thine?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;And who are hearsed that die on the sea?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
  hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
  mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
  America.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:&mdash;a hearse and its plumes
  floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a
  sight we shall not soon see.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;And what was that saying about thyself?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;And when thou art so gone before&mdash;if that ever befall&mdash;then ere
  I can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?&mdash;Was
  it not so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here
  two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Take another pledge, old man,&rdquo; said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up
  like fire-flies in the gloom&mdash;&ldquo;Hemp only can kill thee.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The gallows, ye mean.&mdash;I am immortal then, on land and on sea,&rdquo;
    cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;&mdash;&ldquo;Immortal on land and on sea!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the
  slumbering crew arose from the boat&rsquo;s bottom, and ere noon the dead whale
  was brought to the ship.
