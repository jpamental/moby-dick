  <em>The coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the open
  hatchway; the Carpenter caulking its seams; the string of twisted oakum
  slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frock.&mdash;Ahab
  comes slowly from the cabin-gangway, and hears Pip following him.</em>
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand
  complies with my humor more genially than that boy.&mdash;Middle aisle of
  a church! What&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck&rsquo;s orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the
  hatchway!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but
  they&rsquo;ve set me now to turning it into something else.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
  monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the
  next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those
  same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a
  jack-of-all-trades.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin?
  The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for
  volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand. Dost
  thou never?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I&rsquo;m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but the
  reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there was
  none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark to
  it.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye, and that&rsquo;s because the lid there&rsquo;s a sounding-board; and what in all
  things makes the sounding-board is this&mdash;there&rsquo;s naught beneath. And
  yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter.
  Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the
  churchyard gate, going in?
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Faith, sir, I&rsquo;ve&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Faith? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Why, faith, sir, it&rsquo;s only a sort of exclamation-like&mdash;that&rsquo;s all,
  sir.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Um, um; go on.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I was about to say, sir, that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself? Look
  at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot
  latitudes. I&rsquo;ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the Gallipagos,
  is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me some sort of
  Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. He&rsquo;s always under the
  Line&mdash;fiery hot, I tell ye! He&rsquo;s looking this way&mdash;come, oakum;
  quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the cork, and I&rsquo;m the
  professor of musical glasses&mdash;tap, tap!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  (<em>Ahab to himself</em>.)
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sight! There&rsquo;s a sound! The greyheaded woodpecker
  tapping the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See! that
  thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag, that
  fellow. Rat-tat! So man&rsquo;s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all
  materials! What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here
  now&rsquo;s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the
  expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. A life-buoy
  of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some spiritual sense
  the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver! I&rsquo;ll think of
  that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other
  side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will
  ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound? I go below; let
  me not see that thing here when I return again. Now, then, Pip, we&rsquo;ll talk
  this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee! Some unknown
  conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee!&rdquo;
