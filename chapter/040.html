<p>
  HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.
</p>
<p>
  (<i>Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning, and
  lying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus</i>.)
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!
 Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!
 Our captain&rsquo;s commanded.&mdash;
</pre>
<p>
  1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don&rsquo;t be sentimental; it&rsquo;s bad
  for the digestion! Take a tonic, follow me!
</p>
<p>
  (<i>Sings, and all follow.</i>)
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Our captain stood upon the deck,
A spy-glass in his hand,
A viewing of those gallant whales
That blew at every strand.
Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,
And by your braces stand,
And we&rsquo;ll have one of those fine whales,
Hand, boys, over hand!
So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!
While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!
</pre>
<p>
  MATE&rsquo;S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight bells there, forward!
</p>
<p>
  2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d&rsquo;ye hear,
  bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call
  the watch. I&rsquo;ve the sort of mouth for that&mdash;the hogshead mouth. So,
  so, (<i>thrusts his head down the scuttle</i>,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight
  bells there below! Tumble up!
</p>
<p>
  DUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark
  this in our old Mogul&rsquo;s wine; it&rsquo;s quite as deadening to some as filliping
  to others. We sing; they sleep&mdash;aye, lie down there, like ground-tier
  butts. At &rsquo;em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail &rsquo;em through
  it. Tell &rsquo;em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell &rsquo;em it&rsquo;s the
  resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment. That&rsquo;s the
  way&mdash;<i>that&rsquo;s</i> it; thy throat ain&rsquo;t spoiled with eating Amsterdam
  butter.
</p>
<p>
  FRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let&rsquo;s have a jig or two before we ride to
  anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand by
  all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!
</p>
<p>
  PIP. (<i>Sulky and sleepy.</i>) Don&rsquo;t know where it is.
</p>
<p>
  FRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I say;
  merry&rsquo;s the word; hurrah! Damn me, won&rsquo;t you dance? Form, now,
  Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs!
  legs!
</p>
<p>
  ICELAND SAILOR. I don&rsquo;t like your floor, maty; it&rsquo;s too springy to my
  taste. I&rsquo;m used to ice-floors. I&rsquo;m sorry to throw cold water on the
  subject; but excuse me.
</p>
<p>
  MALTESE SAILOR. Me too; where&rsquo;s your girls? Who but a fool would take his
  left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d&rsquo;ye do? Partners! I must
  have partners!
</p>
<p>
  SICILIAN SAILOR. Aye; girls and a green!&mdash;then I&rsquo;ll hop with ye; yea,
  turn grasshopper!
</p>
<p>
  LONG-ISLAND SAILOR. Well, well, ye sulkies, there&rsquo;s plenty more of us. Hoe
  corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here comes the
  music; now for it!
</p>
<p>
  AZORE SAILOR. (<i>Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle</i>.)
  Here you are, Pip; and there&rsquo;s the windlass-bitts; up you mount! Now,
  boys! (<i>The half of them dance to the tambourine; some go below; some sleep
  or lie among the coils of rigging. Oaths a-plenty</i>.)
</p>
<p>
  AZORE SAILOR. (<i>Dancing</i>) Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig it,
  stig it, quig it, bell-boy! Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!
</p>
<p>
  PIP. Jinglers, you say?&mdash;there goes another, dropped off; I pound it
  so.
</p>
<p>
  CHINA SAILOR. Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of
  thyself.
</p>
<p>
  FRENCH SAILOR. Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it!
  Split jibs! tear yourselves!
</p>
<p>
  TASHTEGO. (<i>Quietly smoking.</i>) That&rsquo;s a white man; he calls that fun: humph!
  I save my sweat.
</p>
<p>
  OLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what
  they are dancing over. I&rsquo;ll dance over your grave, I will&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
  bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners.
  O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews! Well,
  well; belike the whole world&rsquo;s a ball, as you scholars have it; and so
  &rsquo;tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads, you&rsquo;re young; I was
  once.
</p>
<p>
  3D NANTUCKET SAILOR. Spell oh!&mdash;whew! this is worse than pulling
  after whales in a calm&mdash;give us a whiff, Tash.
</p>
<p>
  (<i>They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky darkens&mdash;the
  wind rises</i>.)
</p>
<p>
  LASCAR SAILOR. By Brahma! boys, it&rsquo;ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born,
  high-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!
</p>
<p>
  MALTESE SAILOR. (<i>Reclining and shaking his cap</i>.) It&rsquo;s the waves&mdash;the
  snow&rsquo;s caps turn to jig it now. They&rsquo;ll shake their tassels soon. Now
  would all the waves were women, then I&rsquo;d go drown, and chassee with them
  evermore! There&rsquo;s naught so sweet on earth&mdash;heaven may not match it!&mdash;as
  those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the
  over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.
</p>
<p>
  SICILIAN SAILOR. (<i>Reclining</i>.) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad&mdash;fleet
  interlacings of the limbs&mdash;lithe swayings&mdash;coyings&mdash;flutterings!
  lip! heart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye,
  else come satiety. Eh, Pagan? (<i>Nudging</i>.)
</p>
<p>
  TAHITAN SAILOR. (<i>Reclining on a mat</i>.) Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing
  girls!&mdash;the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still
  rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven in the
  wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted
  quite. Ah me!&mdash;not thou nor I can bear the change! How then, if so be
  transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee&rsquo;s peak
  of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?&mdash;The
  blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (<i>Leaps to his feet</i>.)
</p>
<p>
  PORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing &rsquo;gainst the side! Stand by
  for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell
  they&rsquo;ll go lunging presently.
</p>
<p>
  DANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou
  holdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He&rsquo;s no more
  afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with
  storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!
</p>
<p>
  4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab
  tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a
  waterspout with a pistol&mdash;fire your ship right into it!
</p>
<p>
  ENGLISH SAILOR. Blood! but that old man&rsquo;s a grand old cove! We are the
  lads to hunt him up his whale!
</p>
<p>
  ALL. Aye! aye!
</p>
<p>
  OLD MANX SAILOR. How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort of
  tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there&rsquo;s none but the
  crew&rsquo;s cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort of weather
  when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea. Our captain
  has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there&rsquo;s another in the sky&mdash;lurid-like,
  ye see, all else pitch black.
</p>
<p>
  DAGGOO. What of that? Who&rsquo;s afraid of black&rsquo;s afraid of me! I&rsquo;m quarried
  out of it!
</p>
<p>
  SPANISH SAILOR. (<i>Aside</i>.) He wants to bully, ah!&mdash;the old grudge makes
  me touchy (<i>Advancing</i>.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable dark
  side of mankind&mdash;devilish dark at that. No offence.
</p>
<p>
  DAGGOO (<i>grimly</i>). None.
</p>
<p>
  ST. JAGO&rsquo;S SAILOR. That Spaniard&rsquo;s mad or drunk. But that can&rsquo;t be, or
  else in his one case our old Mogul&rsquo;s fire-waters are somewhat long in
  working.
</p>
<p>
  5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. What&rsquo;s that I saw&mdash;lightning? Yes.
</p>
<p>
  SPANISH SAILOR. No; Daggoo showing his teeth.
</p>
<p>
  DAGGOO (<i>springing</i>). Swallow thine, mannikin! White skin, white liver!
</p>
<p>
  SPANISH SAILOR (<i>meeting him</i>). Knife thee heartily! big frame, small
  spirit!
</p>
<p>
  ALL. A row! a row! a row!
</p>
<p>
  TASHTEGO (<i>with a whiff</i>). A row a&rsquo;low, and a row aloft&mdash;Gods and men&mdash;both
  brawlers! Humph!
</p>
<p>
  BELFAST SAILOR. A row! arrah a row! The Virgin be blessed, a row! Plunge
  in with ye!
</p>
<p>
  ENGLISH SAILOR. Fair play! Snatch the Spaniard&rsquo;s knife! A ring, a ring!
</p>
<p>
  OLD MANX SAILOR. Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring
  Cain struck Abel. Sweet work, right work! No? Why then, God, mad&rsquo;st thou
  the ring?
</p>
<p>
  MATE&rsquo;S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Hands by the halyards! in top-gallant
  sails! Stand by to reef topsails!
</p>
<p>
  ALL. The squall! the squall! jump, my jollies! (<i>They scatter</i>.)
</p>
<p>
  PIP (<i>shrinking under the windlass</i>). Jollies? Lord help such jollies!
  Crish, crash! there goes the jib-stay! Blang-whang! God! Duck lower, Pip,
  here comes the royal yard! It&rsquo;s worse than being in the whirled woods, the
  last day of the year! Who&rsquo;d go climbing after chestnuts now? But there
  they go, all cursing, and here I don&rsquo;t. Fine prospects to &rsquo;em; they&rsquo;re on
  the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a squall! But those chaps
  there are worse yet&mdash;they are your white squalls, they. White
  squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I heard all their chat just
  now, and the white whale&mdash;shirr! shirr!&mdash;but spoken of once! and
  only this evening&mdash;it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine&mdash;that
  anaconda of an old man swore &rsquo;em in to hunt him! Oh, thou big white God
  aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy
  down here; preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear!
</p>
