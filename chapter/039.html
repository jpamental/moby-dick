  (<i>Stubb solus, and mending a brace</i>.)
</p>
<p>
  Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been thinking over it
  ever since, and that ha, ha&rsquo;s the final consequence. Why so? Because a
  laugh&rsquo;s the wisest, easiest answer to all that&rsquo;s queer; and come what
  will, one comfort&rsquo;s always left&mdash;that unfailing comfort is, it&rsquo;s all
  predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor eye
  Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure the
  old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the gift,
  might readily have prophesied it&mdash;for when I clapped my eye upon his
  skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, <i>wise</i> Stubb&mdash;that&rsquo;s my title&mdash;well,
  Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here&rsquo;s a carcase. I know not all that may be
  coming, but be it what it will, I&rsquo;ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish
  leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra,
  skirra! What&rsquo;s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes
  out?&mdash;Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay
  as a frigate&rsquo;s pennant, and so am I&mdash;fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We&rsquo;ll drink to-night with hearts as light,
     To love, as gay and fleeting
  As bubbles that swim, on the beaker&rsquo;s brim,
     And break on the lips while meeting.

<p>
  A brave stave that&mdash;who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir&mdash;(<i>Aside</i>)
  he&rsquo;s my superior, he has his too, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken.&mdash;Aye, aye,
  sir, just through with this job&mdash;coming.
