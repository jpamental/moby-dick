title: CHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.
footnotes: 
 - "The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel; is
    about the bigness of a man&rsquo;s spread hand; and in general shape,
    corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its
    sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than the
    lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when being
    used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a stiff
    pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle."

<p>
  When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and weary
  toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general thing at
  least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in. For
  that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed;
  and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the common usage is to
  take in all sail; lash the helm a&rsquo;lee; and then send every one below to
  his hammock till daylight, with the reservation that, until that time,
  anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each
  couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes
  well.
</p>
<p>
  But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will not
  answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the
  moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch,
  little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In most other
  parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so largely abound,
  their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished, by
  vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a procedure
  notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to tickle them into
  still greater activity. But it was not thus in the present case with the
  Pequod&rsquo;s sharks; though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights,
  to have looked over her side that night, would have almost thought the
  whole round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.

<p>
  Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was
  concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on
  deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for immediately
  suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns,
  so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea, these two
  mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an incessant
  murdering of the sharks,<a href="#ch{{ page.fileSlug }}-fn1" id="ch{{ page.fileSlug }}-fnref1" class="footnote--reference">1</a> by striking the keen steel deep into their
  skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy confusion of
  their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not always hit their
  mark; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of
  the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at each other&rsquo;s disembowelments,
  but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails
  seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be oppositely
  voided by the gaping wound. Nor was this all. It was unsafe to meddle with
  the corpses and ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or
  Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones, after
  what might be called the individual life had departed. Killed and hoisted
  on deck for the sake of his skin, one of these sharks almost took poor
  Queequeg&rsquo;s hand off, when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his
  murderous jaw.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Queequeg no care what god made him shark,&rdquo; said the savage, agonizingly
  lifting his hand up and down; &ldquo;wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de
  god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.&rdquo;
