title: CHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.
footnotes: 
 - "Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical
    mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a
    solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
    steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both
    sides."

<p>
  Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must
  know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
  upon.
</p>
<p>
  Regarding the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
  inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,{% footnote 1 page.fileSlug %} whereof the lower is
  the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an
  unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the
  expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the
  forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two
  almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal
  wall of a thick tendinous substance.
</p>
<p>
  The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of
  oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated
  cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. The
  upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh
  Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is mystically
  carved in front, so the whale&rsquo;s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable
  strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun.
  Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most
  excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale
  contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the
  highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous
  state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of
  the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon
  exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending
  forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is
  just forming in water. A large whale&rsquo;s case generally yields about five
  hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances,
  considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise
  irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can.
</p>
<p>
  I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was
  coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly
  have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like the lining of
  a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s case.
</p>
<p>
  It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
  embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since&mdash;as
  has been elsewhere set forth&mdash;the head embraces one third of the
  whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet
  for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth
  of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship&rsquo;s
  side.
</p>
<p>
  As in decapitating the whale, the operator&rsquo;s instrument is brought close
  to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti
  magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless,
  untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its
  invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which
  is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by the
  enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side, make
  quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter.
</p>
<p>
  Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and&mdash;in
  this particular instance&mdash;almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm
  Whale&rsquo;s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.
