<p>
  Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
  mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod&rsquo;s gurgling track, pushed her on
  like giants&rsquo; palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded so,
  that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world boomed
  before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible sun was
  only known by the spread intensity of his place; where his bayonet rays
  moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned Babylonian kings and
  queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a crucible of molten gold,
  that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.
</p>
<p>
  Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time
  the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye
  the bright sun&rsquo;s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly settled by
  the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun&rsquo;s rearward place, and how the
  same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of
  the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye!
  Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the
  helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;East-sou-east, sir,&rdquo; said the frightened steersman.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Thou liest!&rdquo; smiting him with his clenched fist. &ldquo;Heading East at this
  hour in the morning, and the sun astern?&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then observed
  by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very blinding
  palpableness must have been the cause.
</p>
<p>
  Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse of
  the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost seemed
  to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two compasses
  pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.
</p>
<p>
  But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the old
  man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, &ldquo;I have it! It has happened before. Mr.
  Starbuck, last night&rsquo;s thunder turned our compasses&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Thou
  hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,&rdquo; said the pale mate,
  gloomily.
</p>
<p>
  Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than
  one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as
  developed in the mariner&rsquo;s needle, is, as all know, essentially one with
  the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at,
  that such things should be. Instances where the lightning has actually
  struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the
  effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal; all its
  loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was
  of no more use than an old wife&rsquo;s knitting needle. But in either case, the
  needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or
  lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate reaches all
  the others that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted
  into the kelson.
</p>
<p>
  Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed
  compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the
  precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were exactly
  inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship&rsquo;s course to be changed
  accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her
  undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only
  been juggling her.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing,
  but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask&mdash;who
  in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings&mdash;likewise
  unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some of them lowly
  rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate. But as
  ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed; or
  if impressed, it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their
  congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>
  For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But chancing
  to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper sight-tubes of the
  quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun&rsquo;s pilot! yesterday I wrecked thee,
  and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But Ahab is
  lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck&mdash;a lance without a
  pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker&rsquo;s needles. Quick!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to
  do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to
  revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a
  matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old man
  well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily
  practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors,
  without some shudderings and evil portents.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Men,&rdquo; said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him the
  things he had demanded, &ldquo;my men, the thunder turned old Ahab&rsquo;s needles;
  but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own, that will point
  as true as any.&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this
  was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might
  follow. But Starbuck looked away.
</p>
<p>
  With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
  lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him
  hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the maul, after
  repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the blunted
  needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly hammered that, several
  times, the mate still holding the rod as before. Then going through some
  small strange motions with it&mdash;whether indispensable to the
  magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe of the
  crew, is uncertain&mdash;he called for linen thread; and moving to the
  binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and horizontally
  suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the compass-cards. At
  first, the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at either
  end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently
  watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and
  pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;Look ye, for
  yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone! The sun is East,
  and that compass swears it!&rdquo;
  </p>
<p>
  One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
  persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk away.
</p>
<p>
  In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his fatal
  pride.
