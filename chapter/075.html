title: CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale&rsquo;s Head&mdash;Contrasted View.
---
<h1>
{{ title }}
</h1>
<p>
  Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale&rsquo;s
  head.
</p>
<p>
  As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale&rsquo;s head may be compared to a
  Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded);
  so, at a broad view, the Right Whale&rsquo;s head bears a rather inelegant
  resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old
  Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker&rsquo;s last. And in this
  same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with the swarming
  brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her progeny.
</p>
<p>
  But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
  aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and
  look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head for
  an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its
  sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,
  crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass&mdash;this green,
  barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the &ldquo;crown,&rdquo; and the Southern
  fishers the &ldquo;bonnet&rdquo; of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this,
  you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird&rsquo;s nest
  in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle
  here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you;
  unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term &ldquo;crown&rdquo;
   also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in
  thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea,
  whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner.
  But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a
  diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is
  there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter&rsquo;s measurement, about twenty feet long
  and five feet deep; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons
  of oil and more.
</p>
<p>
  A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped. The
  fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an important
  interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes caused the
  beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold, we now slide
  into the mouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be
  the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah
  went? The roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp
  angle, as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed,
  arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half vertical,
  scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which
  depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone, form those
  Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned. The edges
  of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right
  Whale strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small
  fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time.
  In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order, there
  are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some
  whalemen calculate the creature&rsquo;s age, as the age of an oak by its
  circular rings. Though the certainty of this criterion is far from
  demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical probability. At any rate,
  if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than
  at first glance will seem reasonable.
</p>
<p>
  In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
  concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous
  &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; inside of the whale&rsquo;s mouth;* another, &ldquo;hogs&rsquo; bristles&rdquo;; a
  third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
  &ldquo;There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
  upper <i>chop</i>, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
  *This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or
  rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper
  part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts impart a
  rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance.
</p>
<p>
  As every one knows, these same &ldquo;hogs&rsquo; bristles,&rdquo; &ldquo;fins,&rdquo; &ldquo;whiskers,&rdquo;
   &ldquo;blinds,&rdquo; or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and
  other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has long
  been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne&rsquo;s time that the bone was in its
  glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those ancient
  dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as you may say;
  even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly
  under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a tent spread over
  the same bone.
</p>
<p>
  But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing
  in the Right Whale&rsquo;s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these
  colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think you
  were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its thousand
  pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey&mdash;the
  tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the mouth. It is very
  fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck. This
  particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I should say it was a
  six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that amount of oil.
</p>
<p>
  Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with&mdash;that
  the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads.
  To sum up, then: in the Right Whale&rsquo;s there is no great well of sperm; no
  ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the
  Sperm Whale&rsquo;s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of
  bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the
  Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.
</p>
<p>
  Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie
  together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will
  not be very long in following.
</p>
<p>
  Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s there? It is the same he
  died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded
  away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born
  of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the other head&rsquo;s
  expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the
  vessel&rsquo;s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head
  seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death? This
  Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who
  might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.
