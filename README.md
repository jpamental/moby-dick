# MOBY-DICK; or, THE WHALE.
_By Herman Melville_
A new look at a web-based book.

## Setup

This book site is set up using the static site generator Eleventy. If you want to use the build process, run the command `npm install`, and that should install the bits that you need (presuming you have Node and NPM installed already)

To run the build process and serve the site locally, use this combination of commends to build the Sass files and build/serve the site: `gulp & npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`

## Just the site

If you want to just look at or work with the pre-built site, take a peek in the `_site` directory.
